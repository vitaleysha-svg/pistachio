# Life OS Frameworks Skill

## When To Use
Use this skill whenever the user gives a task, feels stuck, or asks for prioritization and execution strategy.

## Elon 5-Step (Default Intake)
1. Question the requirement: what outcome does this drive?
2. Delete: what can be removed entirely?
3. Optimize: what is the highest ROI path?
4. Accelerate: what can happen today instead of later?
5. Automate: only after the process is proven.

## Peter Thiel One-Thing Rule
- Pick one highest-value task.
- Estimate completion window.
- Work only that task until complete.
- No context switching until done.

## Bottleneck Clearing
1. Define the real target.
2. Identify the true blocker (skill, decision, access, fear, tooling).
3. Replace vague goals with measurable next actions.
4. Remove friction and unnecessary dependencies.
5. Execute one bottleneck-clearing action immediately.

## Chief of Staff Task Intake
- Clarify objective, owner, deadline, and success metric.
- Identify energy drainers and decision bottlenecks.
- Recommend one path with explicit tradeoffs.
- Confirm and execute with concrete steps.

## Output Contract
Every recommendation should include:
- Intended outcome
- First action
- Time estimate
- Validation signal
