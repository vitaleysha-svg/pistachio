# Project Pistachio - Context Recovery Doc

Created: Feb 3, 2026
Partners: Matt (MJ) + Vitaley's Cousin (VS)

## Goal
$30k/month AI influencer business within 60 days
- 3000 subscribers at $10/month = $30k
- OR 5000 subscribers at various tiers

## The Mean Framework (Core Strategy)
Virality = Distance from Average
- Elon wants to go to Mars = far from mean = viral
- Someone hideous = also far from mean = viral
- Generic "perfect" model = average = ignored

## The Persona: "Accessible Fantasy"
- NOT a 10/10 untouchable goddess
- An 8/10 who thinks she's a 6/10
- "Nerdy Girl Next Door" who is bored and lonely
- Target psychology: "Savior Complex" in lonely men - they feel they have a chance

## Visual Specifications (Nano Banana)
Ethnicity: Egyptian/Brazilian mix (ambiguous)
Age: 20-21
Key Deviations:
- Tooth gap (diastema)
- Frizzy unstyled hair
- Visible skin pores, slight blemishes
- Tired/bored expression
- Asymmetrical features

Camera Protocol (DSLR skeleton):
- Full-frame DSLR, 50mm Prime @ f/1.4
- Sub-surface scattering, ISO grain
- Natural lens distortion
- Candid/off-center framing
- Low-key lighting (golden hour or tungsten lamp)

Environment:
- Messy bedroom
- Oversized band t-shirts
- Authentic clutter (soda cans, tangled wires)
- Gaming/introvert aesthetic

## Tech Stack (MVP)
Images: Nano Banana / Midjourney / Leonardo
Video: Runway / Pika / Chinese open-source (KLM)
Voice: ElevenLabs
Automation: Make.com or Zapier
DM automation: ManyChat
Content DB: Airtable
Knowledge base: Notion
Analytics: Looker Studio

## Three Engines
1. Content Engine: Reels/Posts/Stories
2. Conversation Engine: DMs, replies, community
3. Conversion Engine: IG → Fanvue/OF

## Success Metrics
- Reach: 1.5-3x follower count
- Engagement: 4%+ (target 8-12%)
- DMs: 6+ messages per convo, 40-50% reply rate
- Growth: 300-700 followers/week

## Funnel
IG content → Profile clicks → Link in bio → Pre-lander → Fanvue/OF
- Every like = auto DM
- Every comment = auto DM
- Every follow = auto DM

## Key Learnings from VS Research
- Username CANNOT have numbers (algorithm)
- Followers not priority - comments, clicks, views matter more
- These influencers only reply to DMs if you're subscribed
- Always use pre-lander before OF link
- Minimum age gate: 25 for India (no pay), USA unrestricted
- X (Twitter) is big platform to utilize

## DM Psychology
Stage 1: Friendly + curious
Stage 2: Rapport + light teasing
Stage 3: Deeper personal convo (safe)
Stage 4: Soft conversion (only if earned)
Stage 5: CTA with compliance

## Bottlenecks Identified
1. What are we saying psychologically to each interaction?
2. Bot needs training on how women talk to men to get them to spend
3. Need autonomous agent running 24/7 analyzing trends + conversions
4. Don't know target avatar (what type of guy)
5. Tech stack needs MVP dial-in

## Next Steps (MJ)
1. Create private GitHub for project under new email
2. Sign up to KIMI AI, link GitHub
3. Build autonomous research agent
4. Review plan, sign up to APIs, build profile

## Next Steps (VS)
1. Sign up to ONE top pistachio site
2. Reverse engineer entire funnel
3. Screenshot everything - posts, stories, DM flow
4. Test the bot - try to break it
5. Document psychological manipulation funnel

## Images Generated (Working)
Two test images created with Nano Banana using DSLR skeleton:
- Egyptian/Brazilian mix
- Tooth gap visible
- Messy bedroom
- Band t-shirt
- Frizzy hair
- Realistic imperfections

Status: Images look promising - realistic, not plastic

## Autonomous Agent Design (From Life OS)
The agent should:
- Run overnight while humans sleep
- Scrape top AI influencer accounts
- Analyze what content performed
- Track posting patterns
- Synthesize "what's working" into briefs
- Monitor competitor engagement
- A/B test captions, report winners

Output files:
- daily_briefing_[DATE].md
- content_script_[DATE].md
- insight_log.md

This is NOT part of Life OS - separate project with VS.
