## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### MISSION
Build an AI influencer business generating $30,000/month within 60 days.

### HOW IT WORKS
We create a hyper-realistic AI persona using image generation tools.
We build an audience on Instagram through daily content posting.
We convert followers to paid subscribers on Fanvue using automated DM funnels.
Revenue comes from subscriptions ($10/month base) plus pay-per-view content.

### WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE
This is not theoretical. Real people are doing this right now:

- Emily Pellegrini (AI influencer): $6K to $23K/month in 3 months
- Aitana López (AI influencer): $10-20K/month
- Top performer "Amibnw": $50K/month
- Lil Miquela: $10M+ annually from brand deals

15% of Fanvue's $65 million annual revenue comes from AI creators.
That's approximately $10 million generated by AI personas.

### THE MATH
Original target: 3,000 subscribers at $10/month = $30,000

Better approach based on research:
- 1,500 subscribers at $10 base = $15,000
- PPV and customs adding 100% = $15,000 additional
- Total: $30,000 with half the subscribers

Top earners make 50%+ of revenue from PPV/customs, not subscriptions.
Design the content strategy around tiered reveals, not just monthly access.

### TIMELINE
Week 1: Image generation workflow, hero image, account setup
Week 2: Content library (50+ images), face consistency workflow
Week 3: Instagram launch, ManyChat automation live
Week 4: Fanvue content upload, funnel optimization
Week 5-8: Scale, optimize, hit $30K target

## 2. THE STRATEGY (WHY THIS WORKS)

### THE MEAN FRAMEWORK
This is the core insight that makes this business work.

**Virality = Distance from the Average**

Content that looks like everything else gets ignored.
Content that deviates from the norm captures attention.

Example: @niabasic (AI influencer)
- Ultra-dark skin tone = far from the average AI model
- This deviation creates stopping power
- People pause their scroll

Most AI influencers fail because they create "generic beautiful woman" personas.
These look like stock photos. They blend in. No one cares.

Our persona will have distinctive, memorable features that create deviation:
- Specific ethnic mix (Egyptian/Brazilian)
- Physical quirks (tooth gap, frizzy hair)
- Personality positioning (accessible, not aspirational)
- Aesthetic (messy bedroom, not studio)

### THE "8/10 WHO THINKS SHE'S A 6/10" POSITIONING
Most AI influencers position as "perfect 10" unattainable fantasy.
This actually reduces engagement because it feels fake and distant.

Our positioning: The naturally beautiful girl who doesn't know she's beautiful.
- Doesn't wear makeup
- Doesn't try to look perfect
- Has a messy room
- Seems approachable
- Feels like someone you could actually meet

This creates parasocial connection. Followers feel like they "know" her.
That connection drives conversion to paid content.

### WHY AI INFLUENCERS WORK
1. No scheduling conflicts - content can be generated anytime
2. Perfect consistency - same face, same brand, always
3. Infinite scalability - one person can run multiple personas
4. Lower cost - no model fees, location costs, photographer fees
5. Full control - character never has bad days or scandals

### WHY MOST FAIL
1. Images look obviously AI (plastic skin, perfect symmetry)
2. No face consistency (different person in every image)
3. Generic positioning (looks like every other AI model)
4. No conversion funnel (just posts content, hopes for the best)
5. Wrong platform (OnlyFans is risky for AI content)

We're solving all five problems.

## 3. THE PERSONA (WHO WE'RE BUILDING)

### PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
Ethnicity: Egyptian/Brazilian mix
Age: 21 years old
Name: Amira Noor

**Instagram Username:** Itsamiranoor
**Password:** LolaBMW36!

**Email:** amiranoor741@outlook.com
**Password:** LolaBMW36!

**Fanvue Username:** Itsamiranoor
**Password:** LolaBMW36!

Skin: Dark melanin-rich, visible pores, natural texture
Hair: Dark, frizzy, unstyled (not salon-perfect)
Face: Asymmetrical features, tooth gap (diastema)
Expression: Tired, bored, candid (not posed smiling)
Body type: Natural, not fitness model
Style: Oversized vintage band t-shirts, casual

### PERSONALITY
Name: Amira Noor
Vibe: Chill, unbothered, slightly mysterious

Creates texture and movement that feels authentic.

**Tired expression:** Most AI images have posed smiles.
Candid, unbothered expressions feel more real.

**Messy room:** Perfection signals "fake."
Authentic clutter signals "real person's space."

**Dark skin:** Creates visual distinction from the sea of light-skinned AI models.
Leverages the Mean Framework (deviation = attention).

**Band t-shirt:** Gives personality and relatability.
Creates conversation starters ("what band is that?").

## 5. IMAGE GENERATION (MIDJOURNEY MASTERY)

This section contains everything needed to generate photorealistic images
that don't look like AI. - Depending on the tier of what I select, this will cost from anywhere between $8 to $50 a month. I will start with the $30 package as it gives us HD options, and go from there.

### THE CORE PROBLEM
AI images look fake because of:
1. Plastic/waxy skin - over-smoothed, no pores
2. Perfect symmetry - real faces are asymmetrical
3. No imperfections - missing wrinkles, freckles, blemishes
4. Flat lighting - unrealistic shadow placement
5. Oversaturation - colors too vibrant
6. High-frequency digital detail - looks 3D rendered

The solution: Prompt for imperfections FIRST, use specific settings,
and understand what makes images look photographic vs AI.

### THE GOLDEN RULE
**Imperfections = Real**
**Perfection = AI**

Lead with flaws in your prompts. The AI naturally smooths and perfects.
You must counter-prompt with specific imperfections.

### CRITICAL MIDJOURNEY SETTINGS

**Setting: --style raw**
What it does: Removes Midjourney's automatic "beautification"
Why essential: Without this, Midjourney adds artistic flair that screams AI
Always use: Yes, on every photorealistic prompt

**Setting: --s (stylize)**
Recommended value: 50-150
What it does: Controls how much artistic interpretation Midjourney adds
Lower = more realistic, follows prompt closely
Higher = more artistic, Midjourney takes liberties
For photorealism: Use 50 or 100

**Setting: --q (quality)**
Recommended value: 2
What it does: Controls rendering quality and detail
Higher = more texture detail, better lighting
Values: 0.25 (draft), 1 (standard), 2 (high quality)
For photorealism: Always use 2

**Setting: --ar (aspect ratio)**
Recommended value: 4:5 or 3:4
What it does: Sets image dimensions
4:5 is standard Instagram portrait ratio
3:4 is classic photo print ratio
For portraits: Use 4:5

**Setting: --no (negative prompt)**
What it does: Tells Midjourney what to avoid
Essential for removing AI artifacts
See negative prompts section below

### THE SETTINGS STACK (USE THIS ON EVERY PROMPT)
`--style raw --s 100 --q 2 --ar 4:5`

### PROMPT STRUCTURE
A photorealistic prompt has this structure:

[Subject with physical details and imperfections],
[Clothing and styling],
[Expression and pose],
[Camera and lens specification],
[Lighting description],
[Background/environment],
[Film stock or color treatment],
[Settings]
[Negative prompts]

### CAMERA TERMINOLOGY THAT WORKS
AI has been trained on millions of photos with EXIF data.
Naming specific cameras and lenses dramatically increases realism.

**Camera bodies to use:**
- Canon 5D Mark IV (warm, cinematic tones)
- Sony A7R IV (sharp detail, neutral)
- Fujifilm X-T5 (film-like colors)
- Hasselblad 500C/M (medium format, timeless)

**Lens specifications:**
- 85mm f/1.4 (classic portrait, creamy bokeh)
- 85mm f/1.8 (sharp portrait lens)
- 50mm f/1.4 (natural perspective)
- 35mm f/1.4 (environmental portrait)

**Aperture effects:**
- f/1.2 to f/2: Extreme background blur, dreamy
- f/2.8 to f/4: Moderate blur, more sharpness
- f/5.6+: Deep focus, not recommended for portraits

**Film stocks for color:**
- Kodak Portra 400 (warm skin tones, forgiving)
- Fujifilm Pro 400H (natural, soft pastels)
- Kodak Ektachrome E100 (vibrant, high contrast)

### SKIN TEXTURE KEYWORDS (CRITICAL)
Instead of generic descriptions, use specific texture language:

**DO USE:**
- visible skin pores
- fine lines
- subtle blemishes
- natural skin variation
- slight asymmetry
- realistic sheen
- sub-surface scattering skin
- age-appropriate texture

**DO NOT USE:**
- perfect skin
- flawless
- smooth
- airbrushed
- beautiful (triggers beautification)
- gorgeous (triggers beautification)

### IMPERFECTION KEYWORDS (CRITICAL)
Lead your prompts with these:

**Facial:**
- tooth gap diastema
- asymmetrical features
- one eyebrow slightly higher
- subtle under-eye circles
- natural expression lines
- visible pores

**Hair:**
- frizzy unstyled hair
- stray hairs
- hair flyaways
- natural hair texture
- not salon-perfect

**Expression:**
- tired expression
- bored expression
- candid moment
- not posed
- looking away from camera
- natural resting face

### LIGHTING KEYWORDS
Realistic lighting makes or breaks photorealism.

**Natural light:**
- soft window light from camera left
- golden hour light
- overcast daylight
- dappled sunlight through blinds

**Artificial light:**
- warm tungsten lamp lighting
- practical lighting (lamps visible in scene)
- dim ambient lighting
- single overhead light source

**Avoid:**
- ring light (screams "influencer fake")
- studio lighting (unless that's the context)
- flat lighting
- no shadows

### BACKGROUND KEYWORDS
Backgrounds signal "real" or "fake" immediately.

**Realistic backgrounds:**
- messy bedroom with authentic clutter
- unmade bed visible
- clothes on floor
- posters on walls
- practical lamps
- gaming setup
- natural window light

**Avoid:**
- plain white background
- studio backdrop
- perfectly clean room
- stock photo environments
- generic interior

### NEGATIVE PROMPT (USE ON EVERY IMAGE)
This removes AI artifacts. Copy exactly:

`--no plastic, oversaturated, airbrushed, waxy, over-smoothed, flat lighting, artificial, 3D rendered, glossy, shiny, uncanny, filters, photoshop, makeup, perfect, beautiful, symmetrical, smooth skin, studio lighting, ring light`

## 6. FACE CONSISTENCY (COMFYUI + INSTANTID)

### THE PROBLEM
Midjourney generates different faces every time.
Even with the same prompt and seed, faces vary.
This breaks the illusion of a real person.

### THE SOLUTION
Use ComfyUI with InstantID and IP-Adapter to lock in a consistent face.
Once you have the "hero image" from Midjourney, use that face for all future images.

### TECHNIQUE COMPARISON

| Method | Difficulty | Quality | Speed | Training Required | Best For |
|--------|------------|---------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| InstantID | Easy (5-10 min setup) | 82-86% consistency | 12-18 sec/image | None | Fast iterations, angle variations |
| IP-Adapter FaceID Plus V2 | Easy (5-10 min setup) | 85-92% consistency | 15-30 sec/image | None | Best balance of speed and quality |
| LoRA Training | Medium (3-5 hours total) | 95-98% consistency | Normal speed after training | 3-5 hours with 15-30 images | Maximum consistency for long-term character |

### RECOMMENDATION
Start with InstantID + IP-Adapter (no training, good results).
If consistency isn't good enough, invest in LoRA training later.

## 7. VIDEO GENERATION (WAN2.1)

### WHY VIDEO
Instagram Reels perform best for discovery.
55% of Reel views come from non-followers.
Video content gets more engagement than static images.

### THE CHALLENGE
AI video quality is still below AI image quality.
Faces can distort during movement.
Keep movements subtle to maintain quality.

### WAN2.1 OVERVIEW
Wan2.1 is state-of-the-art open source video generation.
Released late 2025, 15K+ GitHub stars.
Can generate realistic video from text prompts.
Can also animate existing images.

### INSTALLATION

**Step 1: Clone repository**
`git clone https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1.git`
`cd Wan2.1`

**Step 2: Create environment**
`conda create -n wan python=3.10`
`conda activate wan`

**Step 3: Install dependencies**
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Step 4: Download models**
Follow instructions in repository
Models are large (10GB+)

**Step 5: Run**
`python generate.py --prompt "your prompt"`

### VIDEO PROMPT TEMPLATE

```
Egyptian/Brazilian mix woman, 21 years old,
subtle breathing movement, natural blinking,
messy bedroom with authentic clutter,
oversized vintage band t-shirt,
candid selfie angle, slight head movement,
dim ambient lighting, tungsten lamp
```

### CRITICAL VIDEO TIPS

1. **Keep movements subtle**
   - Breathing
   - Blinking
   - Slight head turn
   - Hair movement
   NOT: Walking, dancing, large gestures

2. **Match the still image**
   - Use same lighting
   - Same clothing
   - Same background

3. **Short duration**
   - 2-4 seconds is optimal
   - Longer = more artifacts

4. **Post-process**
   - Add music/sound
   - Slight grain filter
   - Match color grade to stills

### ALTERNATIVE: RUNWAY
If Wan2.1 is too technical, Runway is easier.

Website: runway.ml
Cost: $15-76/month
Quality: Good, but less control
Best for: Quick video generation without setup

## 8. PLATFORM SETUP (FANVUE, INSTAGRAM, MANYCHAT)

### FANVUE SETUP

**Why Fanvue (not OnlyFans):**
- Explicitly welcomes AI creators
- Built-in discovery (OnlyFans has none)
- Same 80/20 revenue split
- Lower risk of account termination

**Step 1: Create account**
Go to fanvue.com
Click "Become a Creator"
Enter email, create password
Verify email

**Step 2: Set up profile**
Upload profile photo (your best hero image)
Write bio (200-300 characters)
Set username (same as Instagram if possible)
Add header image

**Step 3: Configure pricing**
Base subscription: $9.99-14.99/month recommended
- Too low = perceived as low value
- Too high = barrier to entry
- $9.99 is psychological sweet spot

**Step 4: Set up PPV pricing**
Individual posts: $5-50 depending on content
Message unlocks: $10-100 depending on content
Custom requests: $50-500+

**Step 5: Verification**
Fanvue requires ID verification
This is for the account owner, not the AI persona
Follow their KYC process

**Step 6: Payment setup**
Connect bank account or payment method
Set payout schedule (weekly recommended)

### INSTAGRAM SETUP

**Step 1: Create account**
Use phone number (not email for better security)
Choose username carefully (see rules below)
Don't add profile photo yet

**Step 2: Username rules**
NO numbers (algorithm penalty)
NO underscores if possible
Short and memorable
Easy to spell
Available across platforms

Bad: @beauty_girl_2024, @ai_model_xxx

**Step 3: Wait 24-48 hours**
Don't add content immediately
Let account "warm up"
Instagram flags accounts that act too fast

**Step 4: Set up profile**
Add profile photo (hero image)
Write bio:
- 150 characters max
- Include call to action
- Include link (Linktree or direct to Fanvue)
- Don't mention AI

**Step 5: Switch to Creator account**
Settings > Account > Switch to Professional Account
Choose Creator
Select category

**Step 6: Connect ManyChat**
After ManyChat setup, connect accounts
This enables DM automation

### INSTAGRAM CONTENT RULES

**AI Disclosure:**
As of 2026, Instagram REQUIRES "Made with AI" label.
Not labeling can result in:
- Up to 80% reach penalty
- Account restrictions
- Potential termination

How to label:
When posting, toggle "Label as Made with AI"
This is mandatory, not optional

**Content Guidelines:**
- No explicit nudity on Instagram
- Suggestive is OK, explicit is not
- Save explicit content for Fanvue
- Instagram is for building audience, not monetization

### MANYCHAT SETUP

**Step 1: Create account**
Go to manychat.com
Sign up with email
Select Instagram as primary platform

**Step 2: Connect Instagram**
Authorize ManyChat to access your Instagram
Grant all permissions
This requires a Creator or Business account

**Step 3: Create Welcome Flow**
This triggers when someone follows you

Flow structure:
1. Wait 1 minute (don't seem automated)
2. Send greeting message
3. Ask a question to start conversation
4. Based on response, continue flow

Example welcome message:
"hey :) thanks for the follow! how'd you find me?"

**Step 4: Create Comment Trigger**
This responds when someone comments a keyword

Setup:
- Trigger: Comment contains "link" or "more"
- Action: Send DM with next step
- Include delay (30-60 seconds)

Example response:
"hiii you wanted the link right? what's your email and i'll send it over"

**Step 5: Create Keyword Flows**
Different keywords = different flows

Keywords to set up:
- "link" - sends Fanvue link
- "hey" / "hi" - starts conversation
- "more" - teases content, asks for email
- Custom keywords from your CTAs

**Step 6: Test everything**
Follow your own account from another account
Comment keywords
Verify DMs are sending correctly

**Step 7: Monitor and optimize**
Check ManyChat analytics daily
See which flows convert best
Adjust messaging based on results

## 9. CONTENT STRATEGY

### CONTENT VOLUME REQUIREMENTS

**Before launch:**
- Minimum 50 images
- Recommended 100+ images
- All with consistent face
- Variety of poses, outfits, settings

**After launch:**
- 1 feed post per day (minimum)
- 3-5 Stories per day
- 1-2 Reels per week

**Time investment:**
- 10-15 hours/week for content generation
- 5-10 hours/week for engagement and DMs

### CONTENT TYPES AND THEIR PURPOSE

**Feed Posts (static images):**
- Best engagement rate (carousels: 10.15%)
- Shows up in follower feeds
- Good for detailed photos
- Post 1x per day

**Stories:**
- Disappear after 24 hours
- Higher conversion rate than Reels
- 50% of users visit websites after Stories
- Good for day-in-life content
- Post 3-5x per day

**Reels (video):**
- Best for discovery
- 55% views from non-followers
- Lower engagement rate (0.50%)
- Good for reaching new people
- Post 1-2x per week

### CONTENT CALENDAR TEMPLATE

**Monday:**
- Feed: Outfit of the day
- Stories: Morning routine (3-4 slides)
- DM check-in

**Tuesday:**
- Feed: Close-up portrait
- Stories: Music I'm listening to
- Reel: Transition or trend

**Wednesday:**
- Feed: Gaming/hobby content
- Stories: Behind the scenes
- DM check-in

**Thursday:**
- Feed: Mirror selfie
- Stories: Q&A answers
- DM check-in

**Friday:**
- Feed: Moody/artistic shot
- Stories: Weekend plans teaser
- Reel: Viral trend participation

**Saturday:**
- Feed: Casual candid
- Stories: Day-in-life
- DM check-in

**Sunday:**
- Feed: Soft/intimate content
- Stories: Lazy Sunday vibes
- Planning for next week

### CAPTION STRATEGY

**Length:**
- Short captions perform better
- 1-2 sentences max
- Or single word/emoji

**Style (matching persona):**
- Lowercase only
- Minimal punctuation
- Few emojis
- Cryptic/mysterious vibes

**Examples:**
- "cant sleep"
- "new shirt"
- "bored"
- "🌙"
- "u up?"
- "thinking"

**Call to Action:**
- Don't be obvious ("link in bio!")
- Be subtle ("more on my other page")
- Or mysterious (no CTA, let curiosity drive)

### HASHTAG STRATEGY

Use: 3-5 hashtags per post (not 30)
Place: In first comment, not caption
Mix: 2 large, 2 medium, 1 niche

Example set:
- #mood (large)
- #vibes (large)
- #darkskin (medium)
- #naturalhair (medium)
- #melaninqueen (niche)

Rotate hashtags to avoid shadowban.
Track which drive the most discovery.

## 10. FUNNEL ARCHITECTURE

### THE COMPLETE FLOW

**Stage 1: Discovery (Instagram)**
↓
Reels reach non-followers
Someone sees content and follows
↓
**Stage 2: Welcome (ManyChat)**
↓
ManyChat detects new follow
Sends automated welcome DM
Starts conversation
↓
**Stage 3: Nurturing (Stories + DMs)**
↓
Daily Stories keep you top of mind
DM conversations build connection
Multiple touchpoints before asking for anything
↓
**Stage 4: Conversion (Link Drop)**
↓
After rapport built, mention "other content"
Drop Fanvue link
They subscribe
↓
**Stage 5: Monetization (Fanvue)**
↓
Base subscription = recurring revenue
PPV messages = additional revenue
Custom requests = premium revenue

### CONVERSION METRICS TO EXPECT

| Stage | Benchmark |
|-------|-----------|
| Reel views to follows | 1-3% |
| Follows to DM response | 20-40% |
| DM to link click | 10-20% |
| Link click to subscribe | 5-15% |
| Overall follow to sub | 0.5-2% |

Example with 10,000 followers:
- 2,000-4,000 respond to DMs
- 400-800 click link
- 40-120 subscribe

At $10/month = $400-1,200/month base
PPV can double this = $800-2,400/month
From just 10,000 followers.

### KEY CONVERSION POINTS

**Point 1: Reel to Follow**
Optimize for: Stopping the scroll
What works: Distinctive look, curiosity, Mean Framework
Metric: Follow rate from profile visits

**Point 2: Follow to DM Response**
Optimize for: Starting conversation
What works: Warm, personal welcome message
Metric: DM response rate

**Point 3: DM to Trust**
Optimize for: Building rapport
What works: Multiple messages before asking anything
Metric: Messages before link drop

**Point 4: Trust to Click**
Optimize for: Natural transition to link
What works: "You asked about my other content..."
Metric: Link click rate

**Point 5: Click to Subscribe**
Optimize for: Landing page conversion
What works: Good Fanvue profile, clear value
Metric: Fanvue conversion rate

## 11. DM PSYCHOLOGY AND SCRIPTS

### THE PSYCHOLOGY

**Why DMs work:**
1. Personal attention (feels 1-on-1)
2. Private space (can say more than public)
3. Low commitment (just responding)
4. Reciprocity (they feel obligated to respond)
5. Curiosity (what will she say next?)

**The stages of DM conversion:**
1. Introduction (warm greeting)
2. Rapport (personal questions)
3. Interest (they ask about you)
4. Tease (hint at more content)
5. Bridge (natural transition to link)
6. Convert (they subscribe)

**CRITICAL:** Never rush to the link.
More messages = higher conversion.
Minimum 5-10 exchanges before mentioning link.

### DM SCRIPT TEMPLATES

**WELCOME MESSAGE (New follower)**
Purpose: Start conversation, seem human

Options:
- "hey :) thanks for following! how'd you find me?"
- "hiii new here? what made you follow?"
- "yo thanks for the follow 💕 you from ig or somewhere else?"

Wait for response before continuing.

**RESPONSE TO "Instagram"**
Purpose: Build rapport

- "nice nice. what caught your attention?"
- "oh cool. you been on here long?"
- "haha yeah ig algorithm is wild. what do you usually watch?"

**RESPONSE TO COMPLIMENT**
Purpose: Accept gracefully, redirect to them

- "aw thank you 🥺 that's sweet"
- "haha you're cute. where you from?"
- "thanks babe. what's your name?"

**BUILDING RAPPORT**
Purpose: Get them talking about themselves

- "so what do you do? like for work or whatever"
- "you watch any shows? im bored need recommendations"
- "whats ur music taste? i need new songs"

**TRANSITION TO TEASE**
Purpose: Plant seed about more content

- "btw i post more stuff on my other page... if you're curious"
- "lol my content here is pretty tame compared to my other stuff"
- "i have this other page where i post... different things"

**THE BRIDGE**
Purpose: Natural transition to link

When they ask about it:
- "you wanna see? i can send you the link"
- "its on fanvue. want me to drop the link?"
- "yeah its paid but like... worth it lol"

**THE CLOSE**
Purpose: Send link, handle objections

- "here u go [link] lmk what u think"
- "just made it like $10... cheaper than netflix haha"
- "i post way more there. like actually good stuff"

### OBJECTION HANDLING

**"I don't pay for content"**
Response: "haha fair. no pressure just lmk if you change your mind 💕"

**"Too expensive"**
Response: "yeah i get it. maybe next time"

**"Can you send me something free?"**
Response: "maybe later if you're nice 😏 for now its on the page"

**"I'm broke"**
Response: "lol me too. no stress"

### TONE GUIDELINES

**DO:**
- Use lowercase
- Keep responses short (1-2 sentences)
- Use some emojis but not too many
- Be warm but not desperate
- Take time between responses (don't reply instantly)
- Let them pursue you

**DON'T:**
- Use proper grammar/punctuation
- Write paragraphs
- Be overly sexual in DMs (save for paid)
- Push too hard for conversion
- Reply instantly every time
- Seem automated

## 12. REVENUE MODEL

### REVENUE STREAMS

**Stream 1: Base Subscriptions**
What: Monthly recurring subscription to Fanvue
Price: $9.99-14.99/month
Your cut: 80% (after Fanvue's 20%)
At 1,000 subs x $10 = $8,000/month net

**Stream 2: Pay-Per-View (PPV)**
What: Individual content sold to existing subscribers
Price: $5-50 per piece
Your cut: 80%
Subscribers who buy PPV: 20-40%
Example: 1,000 subs x 30% x $20 avg = $6,000/month net

**Stream 3: Customs**
What: Personalized content requests
Price: $50-500+ per request
Your cut: 80%
Subscribers who buy customs: 5-10%
Example: 1,000 subs x 7% x $100 avg = $5,600/month net

**Stream 4: Tips**
What: Voluntary tips from subscribers
Variable, usually 5-10% of base revenue
Example: $1,000-2,000/month from tips

### REVENUE BREAKDOWN (TOP PERFORMERS)

Based on research, top AI influencer revenue splits:

- Base subscriptions: 30-40%
- PPV content: 35-45%
- Customs: 15-25%
- Tips: 5-10%

This means: PPV and customs often exceed base subscription revenue.
Design content strategy around tiered reveals, not just monthly access.

### PATH TO $30K/MONTH

**Conservative scenario (Month 2):**
- 1,500 subscribers at $10/month
- Base: $15,000 gross → $12,000 net
- PPV (30% buy, $25 avg): $11,250 gross → $9,000 net
- Customs (5%, $150 avg): $11,250 gross → $9,000 net
- Total: ~$30,000 net

**Aggressive scenario (Month 2):**
- 1,000 subscribers at $15/month
- Base: $15,000 gross → $12,000 net
- PPV (40% buy, $30 avg): $12,000 gross → $9,600 net
- Customs (10%, $100 avg): $10,000 gross → $8,000 net
- Total: ~$30,000 net

### PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

**Base subscription:**
- $9.99 = Mass market, high volume
- $14.99 = Premium positioning, moderate volume
- $19.99 = Luxury positioning, lower volume

For new accounts: Start at $9.99 to build subscriber count.
Raise price after establishing demand and social proof.

**PPV pricing:**
- $5-15 = Low barrier, impulse buys
- $20-35 = Medium value content
- $50+ = Premium/exclusive content

**Custom pricing:**
- $50-100 = Simple requests
- $100-250 = Medium complexity
- $250-500+ = Complex/time-intensive

## 15. QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

1. **What computer/GPU is available?**
   Need 20GB+ VRAM for face consistency workflow.
   If not available, need to budget for cloud GPU (~$50/month).

2. **Comfortable with ComfyUI?**
   It's node-based, different from Midjourney.
   Learning curve is real. May need tutorial time.

3. **Mac or PC?**
   Mac with 32GB+ unified memory can run InstantID locally.
   PC needs dedicated NVIDIA GPU with 20GB+ VRAM.

### STRATEGY QUESTIONS

4. **How many hours/week available for content?**
   Daily posting requires 10-15 hours/week minimum.
   Who generates content? Who handles DMs?

5. **Who handles DMs at scale?**
   ManyChat automates basics but edge cases need human response.
   This is time-intensive as account grows.

6. **What's the budget?**
   - Midjourney: $30/month
   - ManyChat: $15-65/month
   - Cloud GPU: ~$50/month
   - Total: ~$100-150/month minimum

### MARKET QUESTIONS

7. **What's the actual IG to Fanvue conversion rate?**
   Need real numbers, not guesses.
   Research says 0.5-2% follow to subscribe.

8. **What triggers Instagram bans for AI content?**
   What specific content gets flagged?
   How to stay compliant?

9. **Who are the top 5 AI influencers to study?**
   Need examples beyond @niabasic.
   What are they doing right?

### UNANSWERED QUESTIONS (NEED RESEARCH)

- [ ] What are Instagram's official policies on AI content in 2026?
- [ ] What's the average lifetime value of a Fanvue subscriber?
- [ ] How long do AI influencer accounts typically last?
- [ ] What's the cost per acquisition via paid Instagram ads?
