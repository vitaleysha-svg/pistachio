## Image Generation

### GOLD #1: Midjourney --style raw is mandatory for realism
**Finding:** The `--style raw` parameter reduces Midjourney's automatic beautification, producing more natural, less "AI" looking results.
**Evidence:** Multiple sources confirm this is the single most important parameter for photorealism.
**Action:** Every portrait prompt must include `--style raw --s 100-250`
**Rating:** 10/10

### GOLD #2: Lead with imperfections, not beauty
**Finding:** Describing flaws FIRST in prompts (tooth gap, pores, frizzy hair) produces more realistic results than describing beauty.
**Evidence:** AI tends to smooth and perfect. Counter-prompting with imperfections fights this tendency.
**Action:** Start every prompt with: "visible skin pores, slight blemishes, asymmetrical features"
**Rating:** 9/10

### GOLD #3: Camera terminology makes images real
**Finding:** Specific camera references ("shot on Canon 5D", "50mm f/1.4", "Kodak Portra 400") dramatically increase realism.
**Evidence:** AI has been trained on millions of photos with EXIF data. It knows what "Hasselblad" looks like.
**Action:** Include camera body, lens, and film stock in every portrait prompt.
**Rating:** 9/10

## Face Consistency

### GOLD #4: InstantID + IP-Adapter = near 100% face match
**Finding:** Combining InstantID with IP-Adapter in ComfyUI achieves the highest face consistency without LoRA training.
**Evidence:** Workflow documented at myaiforce.com, achieves better results than either tool alone.
**Action:** Set up ComfyUI with both tools. Use Midjourney for initial generation, ComfyUI for variations.
**Rating:** 10/10

### GOLD #5: You need 20GB VRAM or cloud GPU
**Finding:** InstantID + IP-Adapter requires ~20GB VRAM. Consumer GPUs won't run this locally.
**Evidence:** Technical requirements from InstantID documentation.
**Action:** Budget for RunPod/Vast.ai at ~$0.50/hour OR use Mac with 32GB+ unified memory.
**Rating:** 9/10

## Revenue Reality

### GOLD #6: 15% of Fanvue revenue is AI creators
**Finding:** AI creators already generate 15%+ of all Fanvue platform revenue. This is validated, not theoretical.
**Evidence:** Fanvue hit $65M ARR in 2025, 15%+ from AI = ~$10M from AI creators.
**Action:** Use Fanvue, not OnlyFans. They explicitly welcome AI creators.
**Rating:** 10/10

### GOLD #7: $6K to $23K in 3 months is documented
**Finding:** Emily Pellegrini grew from $6K to $23K/month in just 3 months on Fanvue.
**Evidence:** Documented in multiple industry reports and Fanvue case studies.
**Action:** $30K/month in 60 days is aggressive but within documented possibility range.
**Rating:** 9/10

### GOLD #8: PPV/Customs > Subscriptions for top earners
**Finding:** Top AI influencers make 50%+ of revenue from PPV (pay-per-view) and custom content, not base subscriptions.
**Evidence:** Industry analysis shows base subscription is just the entry point.
**Action:** Design content strategy around tiered reveals and custom request upsells, not just monthly access.
**Rating:** 10/10

## Automation

### GOLD #9: ManyChat delivers 118% more leads than email
**Finding:** DM automation through ManyChat produces 118% more leads than traditional email opt-in landing pages.
**Evidence:** Case studies from ManyChat showing creator results.
**Action:** Every engagement (like, comment, follow) must trigger a DM sequence.
**Rating:** 9/10

### GOLD #10: 99% response time reduction possible
**Finding:** Automated DM responses reduce response time by 99%, critical for conversion.
**Evidence:** ManyChat influencer case studies.
**Action:** Set up ManyChat before launching. Day 1 needs automation ready.
**Rating:** 9/10

## Strategy

### GOLD #11: The Mean Framework is validated
**Finding:** Deviation from average = virality. Dark skin (@niabasic style), imperfections, "accessible" persona all create deviation.
**Evidence:** VS industry research + visible success of non-conventional AI influencers.
**Action:** Double down on the "8/10 who thinks she's a 6/10" positioning. Avoid generic AI model aesthetic.
**Rating:** 10/10

### GOLD #12: Username cannot have numbers
**Finding:** Instagram algorithm penalizes usernames with numbers. This is insider knowledge from VS.
**Evidence:** VS industry research, corroborated by multiple creator guides.
**Action:** Choose a clean, memorable username with NO numbers.
**Rating:** 9/10

## What This Means for $30K/Month Goal

**Math:** 3000 subs @ $10 = $30K (minus 20% platform fee = $24K net)

**Reality Check:**
- Emily Pellegrini has ~1200 subs at ~$19/month average
- Top AI earners are hitting $50K+ with fewer than 2500 subs
- PPV and customs can 2-3x base revenue

**Adjusted Strategy:**
- 1500 subs @ $10 base = $15K
- PPV/customs adding 100% = $30K total
- This is more achievable than pure subscription model
