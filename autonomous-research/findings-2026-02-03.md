## 3. REALISM TECHNIQUES (Agent Research)

### What Makes AI Look Fake

- **Plastic/waxy skin** - Over-smoothed, no pores
- **Perfect symmetry** - Real faces are asymmetrical
- **No imperfections** - Missing wrinkles, freckles, blemishes
- **Flat lighting** - Unrealistic shadow placement
- **Oversaturation** - Colors too vibrant
- **Missing micro-texture** - Uniform detail across face

### The Fix: Imperfections First

**Lead with flaws in prompts:**
```
visible skin pores, slight blemishes, asymmetrical features,
tooth gap, frizzy hair, tired expression, natural skin variation
```

**Camera terminology that works:**
```
shot on Canon 5D Mark IV, 85mm f/1.8 lens,
shallow depth of field, Kodak Portra 400 film simulation
```

### Critical Negative Prompt

```
--no plastic, oversaturated, airbrushed, waxy, over-smoothed,
flat lighting, artificial, 3D rendered, glossy, shiny,
uncanny, filters, photoshop, makeup, perfect, beautiful
```

### Post-Processing (Final Polish)

1. Add film grain (Camera RAW Filter, 20-40 amount)
2. Apply halation effect (subtle glow)
3. Reduce saturation 10-20%
4. Add warmth to shadows
5. Remove high-frequency digital detail

**Golden Rule:** Imperfections = Real. Perfection = AI.

## 5. PLATFORM COMPARISON

| Revenue Split | 80/20 | 80/20 |

## 6. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Week 1 Priorities

1. **Hero Image** - Generate 10+ in Midjourney v7, find THE ONE
2. **Fanvue Account** - Set up monetization platform
3. **Username** - No numbers, no underscores
4. **ComfyUI + InstantID** - Face consistency workflow
5. **ManyChat** - Automation foundation

### Revenue Model (Adjusted)

Original: 3000 subs @ $10 = $30K

**Better approach:**
- 1500 subs @ $10 base = $15K
- PPV/customs = $15K additional
- Total: $30K with half the subscribers

### Risk Factors

1. **Account ban** - Backup accounts essential
2. **AI detection** - Use hybrid human-AI approach
3. **Market skepticism** - 89% of marketers avoid AI avatars
4. **Platform changes** - Diversify beyond IG
