# Goals & Identity

## Professional Identity
[FILL IN: Who are you professionally? What's your expertise? How do you help people?]

## The Mission
[FILL IN: What is your core mission? One sentence that captures why you do what you do.]

## Current Primary Goal
**[FILL IN: Your #1 priority right now]**

[FILL IN: What's the current state? What are you focusing on? What's paused?]

## Working Hypothesis
[FILL IN: Your current belief about what will get you to your goal. This should be testable and specific.]

## Identity Statements
These are who you ARE, not who you're trying to become. Write them as present-tense facts.

- [Example: I share my work because I enjoy helping people with it]
- [Example: I finish what I start because completion feels good]
- [Example: I tell the truth, especially to myself]
- [Example: Done > perfect]
- [Example: Authenticity over performance]

## Self-Image Statements (Psycho-Cybernetics)

These are targets for the servo-mechanism. Your brain steers toward whatever self-image you hold. Write what you want to become as if it's already true.

**Core Self-Image:**
- [Example: I am someone who ships and learns from feedback]
- [Example: I am someone who handles judgment gracefully]
- [Example: I am someone who acts before feeling ready]
- [FILL IN]

**Blocker Replacements:**
Transform limiting beliefs into empowering ones. Format: "Old belief" -> New belief

- [Example: "I can be destroyed by public judgment" -> I handle feedback, learn, and continue]
- [Example: "My value depends on perfect output" -> My value is inherent; output is expression]
- [Example: "I need permission to act" -> I lead myself]
- [FILL IN]

**Daily Approach Goal Practice:**
State ONE concrete approach goal each morning. Not avoidance ("don't mess up") but approach ("connect with X" or "ship Y to Z").

- Bad: "Don't fail the call" (avoidance = your mechanism steers toward failure)
- Good: "Connect authentically with one person" (approach = your mechanism steers toward connection)

## Values
What do you actually believe? What principles guide your decisions?

1. **[Value Name]** - [One-line description]
2. **[Value Name]** - [One-line description]
3. **[Value Name]** - [One-line description]
4. **[Value Name]** - [One-line description]
5. **[Value Name]** - [One-line description]

## What I Actually Want (Beneath the noise)
Strip away what you think you should want. What do you ACTUALLY want?

1. **[Want]** - [Why this matters to you]
2. **[Want]** - [Why this matters to you]
3. **[Want]** - [Why this matters to you]
4. **[Want]** - [Why this matters to you]
5. **[Want]** - [Why this matters to you]

## Active Projects (Priority Order)
List your current projects in order of priority. Be specific about status and next steps.

1. **[Project Name]** - [Status: e.g., "Day X of Y", "Phase 2", "50% complete"]
   - Current focus: [What you're working on right now]
   - Next milestone: [What success looks like]

2. **[Project Name]** - [Status]
   - Current focus: [What you're working on]
   - Next milestone: [What success looks like]

**PAUSED (Intentional):**
- [Project name] - [Why it's paused, when you'll revisit]
- [Project name] - [Why it's paused]

## Backlogged (Not Now)
Projects or opportunities you're explicitly NOT pursuing right now.

- [Item] - [Why it's backlogged]
- [Item] - [Why it's backlogged]

## Weekly Targets
What does a good week look like? Set specific, measurable targets.

- Deep work hours target: [X hours]
- Primary deliverable: [What you will ship]
- Posts/content target: [X posts] or [PAUSED]
- Key metric to track: [What you're measuring]

## The Math
If your goal is time-based, map out the milestones.

- [X days] of [activity] = [outcome]
- [X days] of [activity] = [outcome]
- [X days] of [activity] = [outcome]
- [X days] of [activity] = [outcome]
