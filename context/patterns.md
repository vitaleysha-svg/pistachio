# Behavioral Patterns

A framework for recognizing internal states and patterns that affect performance.

## The Three Modes (Psycho-Cybernetics Framework)

**Source:** Maxwell Maltz's servo-mechanism model - your brain operates like a guided missile, automatically steering toward whatever target (self-image) you give it.

| [LEAD MODE NAME] | [EXECUTE MODE NAME] | [FEAR MODE NAME] |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Balanced, grounded, connected | Analytical, sharp, executes | Scared, avoidant, defensive |
| Pull motivation - "get to" not "have to" | Push motivation, duty-driven | Avoidance motivation |
| Heart magnifies - sees impact, feels connection | Brain reduces - optimizes, manages | Builds forever, never ships |
| Enjoys responsibility AND fun | Takes ownership through willpower | Blames circumstances |
| **Calibrated servo-mechanism** | **Over-revved success mechanism** | **Failure mechanism active** |
| Clear positive goals, relaxed effort | Excessive self-criticism, perfectionism | Excessive negative feedback, avoidance goals |

**Customize your modes:** Replace the bracketed names with labels that resonate for you. Examples:
- [LEAD MODE NAME]: "Centered Self", "Best Self", "Flow State", "The Captain"
- [EXECUTE MODE NAME]: "Worker Mode", "Grind Mode", "Analyst", "The Soldier"
- [FEAR MODE NAME]: "Avoidant Self", "Inner Child", "Scared Self", "The Hider"

### Servo-Mechanism Diagnostic

**Your brain operates like a guided missile:** Set a target, it automatically steers toward it. The mechanism doesn't judge goals - it pursues whatever target you give it.

**Two modes:** Goal-seeking (success) vs Goal-avoiding (failure). "Don't fail" is a TARGET your mechanism steers toward - failure.

**Key insight:** Internal states are FEEDBACK from your servo-mechanism, not character flaws. The mechanism isn't broken - it's accurately pursuing wrong targets because the self-image contains wrong goals.

### The SUCCESS Diagnostic (Lead Mode Check)

When calibrated, these components are present:

| Letter | Component | Check Question |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| S | Sense of direction | Do I have a clear positive goal I'm moving TOWARD? |
| U | Understanding | Am I seeing clearly or reacting emotionally? |
| C | Courage | Am I willing to act before I feel ready? |
| C | Charity | Am I giving or extracting? |
| E | Esteem | Do I believe I deserve success as much as anyone? |
| S | Self-Confidence | Am I accessing past successes or dwelling on failures? |
| S | Self-Acceptance | Am I condemning myself for mistakes? |

---

### The FAILURE Diagnostic (Fear Mode Detection)

When the failure mechanism is running, these show up:

| Letter | Component | Warning Sign |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| F | Frustration | Blocked goals, no creative action, grinding |
| A | Aggressiveness | Hostile, misdirected energy, forced effort |
| I | Insecurity | Doubting self, environment, others |
| L | Loneliness | Cut off, isolated, building instead of connecting |
| U | Uncertainty | Can't decide, analysis paralysis |
| R | Resentment | Holding grudges, "others have it easier" |
| E | Emptiness | Achieving but not accepting, hollow wins |

---

### The Reset Protocol

When FAILURE symptoms appear:

1. **STOP** - recognize which mode you're in
2. **RELAX** - you cannot feel fear when physically relaxed (3 deep breaths, release tension)
3. **RECALL** - one quick success memory, feel that winning feeling
4. **REFRAME** - state a positive APPROACH goal (toward something, not away from failure)
5. **ACT** - one small action toward the goal while relaxed

**The key insight:** Fear mode is not a character flaw - it's excessive negative feedback from a servo-mechanism set to defensive mode. Relax + positive goal = reset.

## Push vs Pull Motivation

**Source:** Tony Robbins/Alex Hormozi insight on sustainable vs limited motivation.

There are two types of motivation:
- **Push** = duty, willpower, "I have to"
- **Pull** = something out there you want to serve more than yourself, "I get to"

Push has a ceiling. Pull is unlimited energy.

**Signs You're in Push Mode:**
- "I have to do this"
- "It's my duty"
- Working because you don't know what else to do
- Grinding without feeling alive
- Managing rather than creating

**Signs You're in Pull Mode:**
- "I get to do this"
- Time disappears
- Connected to the person/impact, not just the system
- Teaching/coaching energy shows up
- Smiling when talking about helping someone

**The shift:** Push got you here. Pull takes you further. Find the thing that gets you up early and keeps you up late WITHOUT willpower.

## Transformation Vocabulary

**Source:** Tony Robbins insight - the words you attach to an experience become your experience. Words program emotions.

**Vocabulary Upgrades (same action, different programming):**

| Old (Push/Duty) | New (Pull/Opportunity) |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I have to" | "I get to" |
| "My duty" | "My opportunity" |
| "Non-negotiable" | "What I'm committed to" |
| "Grind" | "Build" |
| "Suffer for the goal" | "Grow toward it" |
| "Starting over" | "Starting fresh" |
| "I don't know what else to do" | "This is what I'm made for" |

**How To Use:**
- When you catch yourself using push/duty language, notice it
- Swap the word - same action, different emotional programming
- Not fake positivity - genuine reframe of the same truth

**The Meta Rule:** Your emotional home is built by repeated words. Change the words, change the home.

## Your Patterns

Document your personal patterns below using this template format.

---

### Pattern: [PATTERN NAME]
**Trigger:** [What situation or event activates this pattern]
**Signs:**
- [Observable behavior 1]
- [Observable behavior 2]
- [Observable behavior 3]

**What helps:**
- [Intervention 1]
- [Intervention 2]
- [Intervention 3]

---

### Pattern: [EXAMPLE - DELETE OR CUSTOMIZE]
**Trigger:** Task feels too big or ambiguous
**Signs:**
- Avoiding starting
- Switching to easier tasks
- "Not sure where to begin"
- Opening new projects instead of finishing current one

**What helps:**
- Break into 15-minute chunks
- Start with the smallest piece
- Write out the steps first
- Do the avoided thing FIRST in the morning

---

### Pattern: [EXAMPLE - DELETE OR CUSTOMIZE]
**Trigger:** Getting close to done on something
**Signs:**
- Have a project/goal
- Get close to done
- Fear kicks in (not ready, might fail)
- Find another thing to build instead
- "Almost done, just a few more days"

**What helps:**
- Ship ugly first version TODAY
- "Done > perfect" mantra
- Close ONE loop before opening new ones

---

### Pattern: [EXAMPLE - DELETE OR CUSTOMIZE]
**Trigger:** About to take a risk or ship publicly
**Signs:**
- "Not ready yet"
- "Just a few more tweaks"
- "Need to learn more first"
- Physical anxiety in body

**What helps:**
- Set hard deadline (today, not tomorrow)
- Ship ugly
- Name it out loud: "I'm scared of X"
- Ask: "So what? What's the worst that happens?"

---

## Questions to Surface Patterns

When feeling stuck, ask yourself:
- "Which of the three modes am I in right now?"
- "What am I actually scared of?"
- "Have I shipped anything today?"
- "Is this push or pull motivation?"
- "What pattern is running right now?"

*Add your own patterns as you discover them. The act of naming a pattern is the first step to changing it.*
