# Pistachio Project

## Source Of Truth (in order)
1. `PROGRESS.md` - live operational state
2. `context/projects/pistachio/context.md` - current strategy + stack snapshot
3. `CODEX-CHANGES.md` - implemented technical changes
4. `knowledge-base/runpod-automation-playbook.md` - pod operations
5. `knowledge-base/face-consistency.md` - generation quality workflow

## Legacy References (non-authoritative)
- `archive/operations-manual-v1.md`
- `PROJECT-PISTACHIO-PLAN.md`

## Current Priority
1. Raise image quality to stable 7/10+ against OG references.
2. Run LoRA v3 training loop with auto-captions + regularization.
3. Automate pod boot, health checks, backup, and batch generation.
4. Build repeatable multi-channel monetization execution.
