# Project Pistachio - Agent Context

> This file provides full context for the Pistachio CoS autonomous agent.
> Read this FIRST before any research or analysis.

## The Goal

**$30k/month within 60 days** from AI influencer business.
- 3000 subscribers @ $10/month = $30k
- OR 5000 subscribers at various tier mixes

## The Partners

**Matt (MJ):** Tech, automation, agent building, Claude Code expertise
**VS (Vitaley's Cousin):** Industry knowledge, funnel reverse engineering, psychological manipulation expertise

## The Strategy: Mean Framework

**Virality = Distance from Average**

- Elon wants to go to Mars = far from mean = viral
- Someone hideous = also far from mean = viral
- Generic "perfect" model = average = ignored
- @niabasic: Ultra-dark skin = deviation from mean = viral

The persona must deviate from the "average AI model" in specific ways.

## The Persona: "Accessible Fantasy"

**Psychology:** NOT a 10/10 untouchable goddess. An 8/10 who thinks she's a 6/10.
**Archetype:** "Nerdy Girl Next Door" who is bored and lonely
**Target Psychology:** "Savior Complex" in lonely men - they feel they have a chance

### Visual Specifications

**Ethnicity:** Egyptian/Brazilian mix (ambiguous)
**Age:** 20-21

**Key Deviations from "Perfect AI Model":**
- Tooth gap (diastema)
- Frizzy unstyled hair
- Visible skin pores, slight blemishes
- Tired/bored expression
- Asymmetrical features

**Camera Protocol (DSLR Skeleton):**
- Full-frame DSLR, 50mm Prime @ f/1.4
- Sub-surface scattering, ISO grain
- Natural lens distortion
- Candid/off-center framing
- Low-key lighting (golden hour or tungsten lamp)

**Environment:**
- Messy bedroom
- Oversized band t-shirts
- Authentic clutter (soda cans, tangled wires)
- Gaming/introvert aesthetic

## Tech Stack (Current)

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Images | Nano Banana / Midjourney / Leonardo |
| Video | **Wan2.1** (SOTA open-source) / Runway / Pika |
| Voice | ElevenLabs |
| Automation | Make.com or Zapier |
| DM Automation | ManyChat |
| Content DB | Airtable |
| Knowledge Base | Notion |
| Analytics | Looker Studio |

### Video Generation: Wan2.1

**Repository:** `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/pistachio/tools/Wan2.1/`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1 (15K+ stars)

- SOTA performance for open-source video generation
- 1.3B model runs on consumer GPU (8GB VRAM)
- Supports: Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video Editing
- Use Case: Animate still portraits for Reels/Stories

## Three Engines

1. **Content Engine:** Reels/Posts/Stories - the top of funnel
2. **Conversation Engine:** DMs, replies, community - the engagement layer
3. **Conversion Engine:** IG → Fanvue/OF - the monetization layer

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Reach | 1.5-3x follower count |
| Engagement Rate | 4%+ (target 8-12%) |
| DM Depth | 6+ messages per conversation |
| DM Reply Rate | 40-50% |
| Weekly Growth | 300-700 followers |

## Funnel Architecture

```
IG Content → Profile Clicks → Link in Bio → Pre-lander → Fanvue/OF
```

**Automation Triggers:**
- Every like = auto DM
- Every comment = auto DM
- Every follow = auto DM

## Key Platform Rules (VS Research)

- Username CANNOT have numbers (algorithm penalty)
- Followers not priority - comments, clicks, views matter more
- These influencers only reply to DMs if you're subscribed
- Always use pre-lander before OF link
- Minimum age gate: 25 for India (no pay), USA unrestricted
- X (Twitter) is big secondary platform

## DM Psychology Stages

| Stage | Goal |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Friendly + curious |
| 2 | Rapport + light teasing |
| 3 | Deeper personal convo (safe) |
| 4 | Soft conversion (only if earned) |
| 5 | CTA with compliance |

## Current Bottlenecks

1. **Image Generation Workflow** - Not fully dialed in
2. **Face Consistency** - Don't know best tools/techniques
3. **DM Psychology** - Bot needs training on how women talk to men
4. **Target Avatar** - Don't know exact psychographic of ideal customer
5. **Tech Stack MVP** - Need to finalize and connect tools

## Current Status

**Images:** Test images in Nano Banana showing promise - realistic, not plastic
**Funnel:** Not built yet
**Account:** Not created yet
**Automation:** Not connected yet

## What The Agent Should Prioritize

**Immediate (Week 1):**
1. Solve image generation workflow completely
2. Document face consistency techniques
3. Build prompts library for Nano Banana

**Next (Week 2):**
1. Funnel architecture deep dive
2. Competitor funnel teardowns
3. DM psychology templates

**Ongoing:**
1. Trend monitoring
2. Platform policy changes
3. Competitor tracking
4. Risk monitoring
