# RedLine Gen - Project Context

> Chief of Staff + Master Campaign Analyzer
> Side business: Lead generation for car dealerships via Meta ads

## Business Overview

- **Name:** RedLine Gen
- **Type:** Marketing agency (lead gen for car dealerships) + Tools
- **Channels:** Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram)
- **Tools:** GoHighLevel (CRM, landing pages, automation) - resellable to dealership clients
- **Current Clients:** 1 - Space Auto
- **Stage:** Active, generating leads, analyzing performance
- **Model:** Service (ad management + strategy) + Tools (GHL as CRM/tool for dealerships)

## Client: Space Auto

- **Name:** Space Auto
- **Type:** Car dealership (details TBD)
- **Campaign status:** Active Meta ads
- **Data available:** Ads Manager screenshots (weekly)

### Space Auto - Known Details
- **Lead type:** Form submissions (Facebook lead forms)
- **Budget:** Started at $1,500-$2,000/mo, now ~$1,000/mo
- **Budget note:** Budget was cut from $1.5-2K to ~$1K
- **Key pivot:** Space Auto wants to start doing VIDEO ADS targeting people actively looking for a car
- **Their edge:** They're strong at SOURCING cars (finding specific cars for buyers) vs just selling lot inventory
- **Ad strategy shift:** Move from static/generic lot ads → video ads positioning them as "we'll find YOUR car"
- **This is a big differentiator** - most small dealers only advertise what's on the lot
- **Funnel:** Meta Ad → GoHighLevel landing page → 6-8 pre-qualifying questions → CRM → Sales call
- **Speed to lead:** CRITICAL - must call immediately when lead comes in, not even 5 min later
- **Campaign structure:** ABO with 3 adsets (~$11/day each): Prime Leads, Subprime Leads, ForceSpend
- **First analysis completed:** 2026-02-06 (see space-auto/analysis-2026-02-06.md)
