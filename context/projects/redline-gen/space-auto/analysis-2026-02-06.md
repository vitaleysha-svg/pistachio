## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Carousels CRUSH Videos on Efficiency
- Carousels avg CPM: $14-28 | Videos avg CPM: $24-68
- Carousels avg CPL: $2.40-9.70 | Videos avg CPL: $7.80-25.59
- Facebook is charging 2-3x more to show videos

### 2. Testimonial S5 is the Engine
- 73 of 153 leads (48% of ALL leads) from one ad
- $9.07 CPL with massive scale (23,536 impressions)
- Facebook already identified this as winner and pushes budget here

### 3. ForceSpend Strategy is Backfiring
- Highest CPM ($44.27) = Facebook penalizing forced delivery
- Only 10 leads at $13.05 CPL
- The premise (forcing spend on non-winners) is fighting the algorithm

### 4. Frequency is Getting Dangerous
- Overall 2.21 = people seeing ads 2+ times on average
- Prime adset at 1.99 = almost at fatigue threshold
- Need fresh creative or expanded audiences

### 5. Video - Fast Actions is a Hidden Money Pit
- Looks OK (23 leads) but $67.86 CPM is INSANE
- $363.82 spent at $15.82 CPL
- That $364 in SP Carousels would have generated ~41 leads instead of 23

### 6. Retargeting is OFF
- Warm - Retargeting - Website/LP campaign is turned off
- This means people who visited the landing page but didn't convert are NOT being followed up
- Low-hanging fruit being left on the table

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **KILL** these ads: Video - Dont Buy New, Testimonial - Lambo, Video - Why Us (both), Video - Fast Actions
2. **KILL** ForceSpend adset entirely - the concept fights the algorithm
3. **TURN ON** Warm Retargeting campaign - these are the warmest leads
4. **Increase budget** on SP/Carousels adset (best performer)

### Budget Reallocation
| Current | Proposed | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| ForceSpend: $11/day | $0 | Kill it |
| Prime Videos: $11/day | $11/day | Keep but swap underperforming ads |
| SP Carousels: $11/day | **$16-18/day** | Best CPL, give it more |
| Retargeting: $0/day | **$5-8/day** | Turn on, capture warm leads |

### New Creative to Test
1. **More testimonial-style ads** (Testimonial S5 format is proven)
2. **Car sourcing video ads** (Space Auto's new direction)
3. **More carousel formats** (carousels outperform video on CPM)
4. Use hooks from hooks-library.md adapted for automotive

### New Video Ad Scripts Needed (Car Sourcing Angle)
- Hook: "Stop scrolling through dealership lots. We'll find YOUR car."
- Hook: "You've been lied to about buying a car and it's time someone told you the truth"
- Hook: "If you're trying to find the perfect car but every dealership has the same junk - I got you"
- Hook: "This is for you if you're tired of settling for whatever's on the lot"

## Funnel Context (For Reference)
- **Lead flow:** Meta Ad → GoHighLevel Landing Page → 6-8 pre-qualifying questions → CRM → Sales call
- **Speed to lead is CRITICAL** - must call immediately, not 5 min later
- **Lead type:** Form submissions (website leads)
