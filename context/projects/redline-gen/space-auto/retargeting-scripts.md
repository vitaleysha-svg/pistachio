## Script 1: "You Didn't Finish" (Objection Crusher) - 18 sec

**Tone:** Casual, direct, like a friend following up.
**Who's on camera:** Space Auto owner or salesperson

### SCENE 1 - HOOK (0-3s)
- **Setting:** Outside, in front of Space Auto lot. Cars visible but slightly blurred in background. Natural daylight, afternoon sun (golden hour if possible).
- **Framing:** Medium shot, chest up. Phone is handheld, slight natural shake (NOT tripod - needs to feel like a FaceTime call, not a commercial).
- **Blocking:** Already looking at camera when video starts. No walking up. No intro. Mid-thought.
- **Line:** "Hey - you were just looking at our page, right?"
- **Direction:** Head slightly tilted. Not aggressive, not desperate. Like you ran into someone you recognized.

### SCENE 2 - PROOF + ACKNOWLEDGE (3-12s) - Same shot, no cut
- **Line:** "We found 3 cars this week for people who filled out that form. One guy wanted a white Camry under 15K - had it for him in 4 days."
- **Direction:** Hold up 3 fingers on "3 cars" then drop naturally. Matter of fact, not bragging. The number is the anchor.
- **Text overlay:** "We found 3 cars this week" - bold white text, slight drop shadow, lower third. 3 seconds.

### SCENE 3 - CTA (12-18s) - Same shot
- **Line:** "Tell us what car you want. Worst case, you find out what's available. That's it."
- **Direction:** Small shrug on "That's it." Hold eye contact 1 beat after the last word, then cut. No outro graphic - CTA button on the ad handles it.

## Script 2: "The One That Got Away" (Urgency/FOMO) - 17 sec

**Tone:** Storytelling, real urgency but not fake-scarcity.
**Who's on camera:** Same person as Script 1 (consistency)
**Note:** Zero cuts in this entire video. One continuous take.

### SCENE 1 - HOOK (0-3s)
- **Setting:** INSIDE the dealership or office. Sitting down at desk or leaning on counter. NOT standing. The shift from outdoor (cold ads) to indoor (retargeting) signals "come inside, we're inviting you in."
- **Framing:** Medium-close, shoulders and up. Camera at eye level on a surface - NOT held. Feels like a Zoom call.
- **Lighting:** Office lights + window with natural side light. Don't overthink it. Authenticity over production.
- **Line:** "Real quick - let me tell you what happened yesterday."
- **Direction:** Already looking at camera. Lean forward. Half-smile, like you can't believe what you're about to say.

### SCENE 2 - STORY (3-12s) - Same shot, no cut
- **Line:** "Guy wanted a Honda Ridgeline, black, under 20K. We found two options. He waited ONE day to decide. Both got sold. Gone."
- **Direction:** Pacing matters:
  - "Honda Ridgeline, black, under 20K" - tick off with small hand counts, rhythmic
  - "We found two options" - matter of fact
  - "He waited ONE day" - slow down, emphasis on ONE
  - "Both got sold. Gone." - flat delivery, dead serious face, brief pause after "Gone"

### SCENE 3 - CTA (12-17s) - Same shot
- **Line:** "Good cars move fast. Tell us what you want before someone else gets it."
- **Direction:** Snap fingers on "move fast." Point at camera on "tell us." Brief eye contact, cut.
- **Text overlay:** "Good cars move FAST" at snap moment. Bold white, center screen, 2 seconds.

## Script 3: "Sourcing Story" (Social Proof) - 18 sec

**Tone:** Real customer story.
**Two versions:** Real customer OR owner retelling.

### Version A: Real Customer Available

**SCENE 1 (0-7s):**
- **Setting:** Customer sitting in driver's seat of the car Space Auto found. Door open or window down.
- **Framing:** Camera person outside driver's side door. Phone at eye level.
- **Line:** "I looked for this car for 2 months. Every dealer had the same junk. Then I found Space Auto, told them what I wanted, and they had it in [X] days."
- **Direction:** Let them say it naturally. Don't over-script. Beats: (1) frustration of searching, (2) how easy Space Auto made it.

**SCENE 2 (7-13s):** Same shot.
- Customer pats steering wheel or dashboard.
- **Line:** "I'm sitting in it right now."
- **Direction:** Genuine smile. The car IS the proof.

**SCENE 3 (13-18s):** Same shot, lean toward camera.
- **Line:** "Just tell them what you want. That's literally all I did."
- **Direction:** "Literally all I did" - hands up, palms out. Cut.

### Version B: Owner Tells It

**SCENE 1 (0-5s):**
- **Setting:** Owner standing next to a car on the lot. Medium shot.
- **Line:** "Customer came to us last week. Needed a [car], [color], under [price]."
- **Direction:** Hand on car roof. Matter of fact.

**SCENE 2 (5-13s):** Same spot, lean on car.
- **Line:** "We found 3 options in 5 days. She drove off in exactly what she wanted."
- **Direction:** Hold up 3, then 5 fingers. On "exactly what she wanted" - point at camera.

**SCENE 3 (13-18s):** One step toward camera.
- **Line:** "Stop thinking about it. Tell us what you want. We do the hard part."
- **Direction:** "Stop thinking" - flat, direct, no smile. "We do the hard part" - thumb to chest, slight smile. Cut.

## Production Notes (All Scripts)

- **15-20 seconds MAX.** Sweet spot 17-18 sec. Never exceed 25 sec.
- **Shoot ALL scripts in one afternoon** (retargeting + cold traffic = 7 total videos)
  - Retargeting Script 1: outdoor (lot)
  - Retargeting Script 2: indoor (office)
  - Retargeting Script 3: on lot next to a car
  - Cold traffic scripts: mix of indoor/outdoor
- **iPhone, 9:16 vertical** for Meta placements
- **NO background music.** Raw audio only. Music = instant "this is an ad" signal to retargeting audiences who already know you.
- **Full captions/subtitles** via CapCut auto-captions. White text, black outline. Proofread after auto-generate.
- **Thumbnail/first frame:** Person already looking at camera, mouth slightly open (mid-word). Not a posed smile.
- **Retargeting audience already saw cold ads** - these MUST look and feel different. Indoor vs outdoor, sitting vs standing, story vs pitch. Visual variety signals "this is new content."
