# Audit - Skool AI Community MVP (v2)

Date: 2026-02-12
Auditor: Codex
Scope: Full `data/projects/skool-ai-community/` package (114 files)
Method: structural scan + voice lint + manual review of highest-impact member-facing assets

## Audit Standard (Matt-style)
- Direct, short, action-first language
- No corporate filler
- Comparison framing where useful
- Real examples, not abstract claims
- Ops docs are executable without interpretation

## Findings (ordered by severity)

### P0 - Voice Drift in Member-Facing Copy (fixed)
Issue:
Member-facing docs used wording banned by your own voice guide (`leverage`).

Evidence:
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/vsl-script.md:10`
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/skool-page-copy.md:11`
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/social-launch-posts.md:6`
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/modules/module-10-multi-agent/lesson-01-agent-teams-not-agent-chaos.md:5`

Fix implemented:
Rewrote language to concrete outcome terms (`ship better work`, `execution systems`, `scaling`).

Verification:
- `rg -n "leverage" data/projects/skool-ai-community` now returns only research files, not member-facing deliverables.

### P0 - Proof Claims Were Too Generic (fixed)
Issue:
Marketing proof section was abstract and could read AI-generic.

Evidence:
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/vsl-script.md:45`
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/skool-page-copy.md:50`

Fix implemented:
Added concrete proof points from internal research snapshot:
- 14+ shipped projects
- ~$227K traditional build-equivalent output
- ~$1,200 AI tooling cost in measured window

Source:
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/research-matt-usage-extraction.md`

### P1 - Missing Matt Signature Framing in Core Sales Copy (fixed)
Issue:
Skool landing copy did not include a clear wrong-way vs right-way contrast table.

Evidence:
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/skool-page-copy.md` (pre-fix)

Fix implemented:
Added comparison table (`Random Chat Mode` vs `Chief of Staff Mode`).

Result:
Matches your recurring "flipped frame + table" style from voice guide.

### P1 - Ops Ambiguity Around Email Sequence Files (fixed)
Issue:
Both `onboarding-sequence.md` and split per-email files existed without canonical usage rule.

Risk:
Wrong file wired to automation.

Fix implemented:
- Added canonical map: `data/projects/skool-ai-community/marketing/email-sequences/README.md`
- Defined automation rule: use split files, keep overview as strategy summary only.

### P1 - Missing Time/Owner Launch Control (fixed)
Issue:
Ops had checklists but lacked a strict launch timeline with owners.

Fix implemented:
- Added `data/projects/skool-ai-community/operations/day-0-launch-runbook.md`
- Updated `launch-readiness-checklist.md` to require runbook assignment.

### P2 - Real-Example Density in Module 1 (fixed)
Issue:
5-minute win flow was clear but still abstract.

Fix implemented:
Added concrete Matt-style table example tied to your actual operating context.

File:
- `data/projects/skool-ai-community/modules/module-01-first-chief-of-staff/five-minute-win-walkthrough.md:44`

### P2 - Source Traceability Coverage (partially improved)
Issue:
Not all files had explicit source anchors.

Action taken:
Added source anchors to core marketing + module 1 + starter-kit files.

Current status:
- Files with `## Source Anchors`: 49 / 109 markdown assets.
- This is acceptable for templates/checklists, but priority member-facing files now include anchors.

## Additional Validation

### Structural checks
- All module outlines include `Outcome`, `Assignment`, `Pass Criteria`.
- Starter-kit required files exist.
- Marketing required files exist (VSL, Skool page, launch video, 5 shorts, email set).
- Operations required files exist.
- `prd.json` valid JSON.

### Voice lint checks
- No hedge-word clusters in member-facing modules/marketing/ops.
- No corporate filler terms in member-facing docs.

## Residual Risks (still true)
1. Social proof numbers are sourced internally and should be final-approved by Matt/Opus before public publish.
2. Final human polish still needed on VSL delivery cadence (spoken rhythm).
3. Launch readiness is documentation-complete, but still needs one real dry-run in Skool UI.

## Recommendation
Ship this package to Opus review as current best local state.
Then run one final spoken-language pass on:
1. `marketing/vsl-script.md`
2. `marketing/skool-page-copy.md`
3. `marketing/youtube/launch-video-script.md`

That's it.
