# Skool AI Community MVP v2 Execution Plan

## Why v2
v1 had strong ambition but mixed executable path with speculative orchestration and installer complexity. v2 is shipping-focused: immediate member value, clear launch gates, and no installer dependency for day one.

## Product Thesis
People do not pay $40 for information. They pay for behavioral change with low friction.

This MVP sells one promise:
"In under an hour, you will have an AI Chief of Staff workflow you can use every day without technical overwhelm."

## Avatar and Constraints
- Non-technical professionals and creators.
- They are comfortable in browser tools, not CLI-first.
- They need concrete outputs, not abstract AI education.

## MVP Scope (Ship)
1. 5-minute win in browser via Claude.ai.
2. Modules 1-3 fully taught and actionable.
3. Starter kit templates for immediate daily use.
4. Skool copy + launch scripts + onboarding emails.
5. Community operations system for first 100 members.

## Not in MVP (Defer)
1. One-click installer.
2. Native desktop wrappers.
3. Full multi-agent autonomous orchestration engine.

## Workstreams

### Workstream A: Product Experience
- Module 1: First Chief of Staff win.
- Module 2: Auto-save brain behavior.
- Module 3: Goals/patterns/ONE THING operating rhythm.

### Workstream B: Activation and Marketing
- VSL script.
- Skool page copy.
- Launch video + shorts.
- 7-day email sequence.

### Workstream C: Operations
- Community guidelines and moderation policy.
- Onboarding automation and daily operating cadence.
- KPI instrumentation and launch readiness checklist.

## Launch Gates (Binary)
- Gate 1: New user can follow Module 1 without live help.
- Gate 2: 5-minute win completion path is unambiguous.
- Gate 3: Daily ops can run without Matt writing process from scratch every day.
- Gate 4: Metrics tracking is defined before launch.

## Success Metrics
### Week 1
- 25 founding members
- >=70% 5-minute win completion
- >=50% Module 1 completion
- >=30% Day-3 active members

### Month 1
- 100 members
- <=12% month-1 churn
- >=40% module 1-3 completion
- >=20 member screenshots/wins posted

## Execution Model
- Parallel content generation is allowed.
- Quality review is centralized before marking complete.
- No endless task expansion during MVP sprint.

## Operator Rule
If a task does not move activation, retention, or launch readiness, it is not MVP.
