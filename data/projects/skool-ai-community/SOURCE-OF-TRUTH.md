# Source Of Truth - Skool AI Community MVP

This MVP is grounded in Matt's existing corpus, not generic course content.

## Priority Source Set (Read and apply first)
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Life OS operating rules (direct, no fluff, save-first behavior).
2. `AGENTS.md` - execution patterns, morning/evening rhythm, persistence behavior.
3. `SOUL.md` - CoS posture (anticipate, remove friction, protect energy).
4. `USER.md` - Matt context, current business goals, communication style.
5. `context/goals.md` - identity statements, ONE THING operating concept.
6. `context/patterns.md` - push vs pull behavior model and execution style.
7. `data/charisma/matt-voice-guide.md` - explicit writing style constraints and anti-AI checks.

## Supporting Source Set (Methods + proven frameworks)
1. `data/charisma/charlie-cos-operating-manual.md` - CoS framing for high-output creator support.
2. `data/charisma/content-team-build-plan.md` - six-pillar execution style and direct action framing.
3. `data/charisma/scriptwriter-hiring-execution-plan.md` - practical sequencing, clear standards, no fluff.
4. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/README.md` - 6-pillar pedagogy and structure.
5. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/00-infrastructure-overview.md` - checklist-first system design.
6. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/pillar-3-talent-channels/pond-philosophy.md` - "pond" discovery mental model.
7. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/pillar-3-talent-channels/research-framework.md` - role-specific research process.
8. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/role-kickoff-checklist.md` - practical implementation flow.
9. `/Users/mateuszjez/Desktop/howtofindtalent/public/playbook/pillar-6-onboarding/first-7-days.md` - first-week momentum and shipping standard.

## Product-Specific Source Set
1. `data/projects/skool-ai-community/CODEX-EXECUTION-PLAN.md` - original 11-part strategy and task map.
2. `data/projects/skool-ai-community/research-matt-usage-extraction.md` - extracted workflow patterns and behavior proof.
3. `data/projects/skool-ai-community/research-skool-best-practices.md` - platform constraints and launch mechanics.
4. `data/projects/skool-ai-community/research-ai-education-landscape.md` - category positioning and differentiation gaps.
5. `data/projects/skool-ai-community/research-course-design-patterns.md` - module sequencing and completion design.

## Style Contract (Must Hold)
- Short, direct sentences.
- Action-first instructions.
- No corporate language.
- No fake hype.
- Every lesson ends with a concrete output.
- Every system claim maps to an explicit file or repeatable step.

## Validation Protocol
Before marking any deliverable "done":
1. File exists at expected path.
2. Has a concrete member action.
3. Has pass criteria.
4. Reflects Matt voice constraints.
5. Can be run by a non-technical member without live rescue.
