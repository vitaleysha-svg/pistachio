# Skool AI Community MVP - Start Here

This is the operator entrypoint for shipping the first paid version people will gladly pay $39-$49/month for.

## MVP Outcome (what must be true)
By launch day, a non-technical member can:
1. Get a real win in under 5 minutes in browser (no terminal required).
2. Complete Modules 1-3 and leave with a usable personal Chief-of-Staff system.
3. Know exactly what to do daily for the next 7 days.

If those three are not true, do not launch.

## Read In Order
1. `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`
2. `MVP-V2-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`
3. `prd.json`
4. `operations/launch-readiness-checklist.md`
5. `operations/day-0-launch-runbook.md`

## What Is Included Right Now
- Module packages for Modules 1-10
- Starter kit templates for immediate setup
- VSL, YouTube launch scripts, social posts, and email sequences
- Operations SOPs, onboarding automation, and KPI/rollback docs
- Practical orchestration runbook and worker task files

## Explicitly Deferred (Not Blocking MVP)
- One-click installer (`backlog/installer-roadmap.md`)
- Native desktop installer packaging
- Advanced CLI-first onboarding for day-one users

## North Star for Decisions
Prioritize member activation and retention over feature complexity.

## Final Gate Before Publishing Skool
Use `operations/launch-readiness-checklist.md`.
If any P0 item is unchecked, launch is not ready.
