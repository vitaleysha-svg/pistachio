# Installer Roadmap (Deferred)

Installer is intentionally deferred from MVP to reduce execution risk.

## Why Deferred
- Not required to deliver first paid member value.
- Adds support burden and security surface.
- Can be built once demand is proven.

## Milestones
1. Milestone A: Guided browser-first onboarding (already in MVP).
2. Milestone B: Copy-paste script with verification and rollback.
3. Milestone C: Signed native installers for macOS/Windows.

## Entry Criteria to Start Installer Work
- >=100 paid members
- >=50% module 1 completion rate
- repeated member requests for setup simplification
