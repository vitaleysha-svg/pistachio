# Onboarding Email Sequence (Day 0, 1, 3, 7)

## Day 0 - Welcome
Subject: You're in. Start here.

You're in.

Start with Module 1 and run the 5-minute Chief of Staff win.

Do this first:
1. open Module 1
2. run the prompt
3. post your result in #wins

One action. Start now.

## Day 1 - Build momentum
Subject: Keep this simple today

Today, do one thing:
set up your daily log.

Don't overbuild.
Run the template exactly once.

Then post one screenshot in the community.

## Day 3 - Install the memory loop
Subject: This is where it starts compounding

By now you should have:
- ONE THING
- daily log
- morning brief

Today's task:
add your first learned mistake entry.

This is the mechanism that prevents repeated failure.

## Day 7 - Weekly review
Subject: Week 1 review (critical)

Run your weekly review today.

Decide three things:
1. what worked
2. what wasted time
3. what to fix next week

If you complete this, your system is live.
