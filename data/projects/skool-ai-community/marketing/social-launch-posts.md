# Social Launch Posts

## Post 1 - Launch Day
I'm launching a new community: AI Chief of Staff.

This is for non-technical operators who want real AI execution systems, not random prompts.

If you want a 5-minute first win + full implementation path, join here: [link]

## Post 2 - What you'll build
Inside the community, you'll build:
- daily brief
- daily log
- goals/patterns system
- learned-mistakes loop

This is a system, not a content dump.

## Post 3 - Who this is for
If you're a founder, creator, or operator and AI still feels scattered, this is for you.

If you want hype, this is not for you.

## Post 4 - First wins
Founding members are posting first wins in under 5 minutes.

That's the standard: implementation first.

## Post 5 - Final call for founding price
Founding member pricing closes at [date/time].
