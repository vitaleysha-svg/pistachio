# VSL Script - AI Chief of Staff Community

## Target Length
8-9 minutes.

## 0:00-0:30 Hook
You're probably using AI like a search box.
That's the problem.

The real shift is using AI like a Chief of Staff that knows your goals, your patterns, and your active projects.

In this video, I'll show you exactly how to do that without being technical.

## 0:30-2:00 Problem
Most people do this:
- ask one question
- get one answer
- close the tab

Nothing compounds.
Nothing changes.

You stay busy, but your operating system stays the same.

## 2:00-4:00 Bridge
My name is Matt.
I run Life OS every day.

The core shift is simple:
- Save context first.
- Keep one clear priority.
- Run repeatable workflows instead of random prompts.

This is the same approach I use across recruiting, project execution, and operating as Chief of Staff.

## 4:00-6:00 Offer
Inside this community, we build your system in order:
1. First Chief of Staff win in 5 minutes.
2. Auto-save brain so context stops disappearing.
3. Goals and patterns so AI can actually prioritize with you.
4. Advanced modules for autonomy and multi-agent workflows.

You get templates, step-by-step walkthroughs, and live implementation support.

## 6:00-7:30 Proof
You won't get vague theory.
You get files, workflows, and pass/fail criteria.

By the end of the first modules, you'll have:
- working daily brief
- working daily log
- learned-mistakes loop
- a system that keeps getting better

Real proof from the internal build logs:
- 14+ shipped projects documented in Life OS
- $227K+ equivalent traditional build value
- Built with roughly $1,200 in AI tooling costs over the measured window

## 7:30-9:00 Close
If you can follow clear steps, you can run this.

The goal is not to learn "AI stuff."
The goal is to build a system that helps you ship better work every day.

Join the community.
Run the first module.
