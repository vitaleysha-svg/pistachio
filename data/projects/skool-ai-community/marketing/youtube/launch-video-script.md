## Title Idea
I Stopped Using AI Like ChatGPT. Here's My Chief of Staff System.

## Opening (0:00-0:30)
If you're using AI for random questions, you're leaving most of the value on the table.

I'm going to show you the system I use to run AI like a Chief of Staff.

## Problem (0:30-2:30)
Most people have no memory layer.
No priorities layer.
No execution layer.

So every day starts from zero.

## Demo (2:30-6:30)
Walk through:
1. goals file
2. morning brief
3. daily log
4. learned mistakes

Show one real example where context changed the output quality.

## Build Sequence (6:30-9:00)
The exact order:
1. first 5-minute win
2. auto-save brain
3. goals + patterns
4. weekly review

## Offer (9:00-11:00)
I built a Skool community where we implement this step by step.

This is for non-technical people who want real execution gains, not prompt hacks.

## Close (11:00-12:00)
If this resonates, join us and run Module 1.
You'll have your first Chief of Staff output in minutes.
