# Shorts Scripts (5)

## Short 1 - 5-Minute Win
Most people use AI wrong.
Open Claude.
Paste one Chief of Staff prompt.
Get a real plan for today.
That is your first rep.

## Short 2 - ONE THING
If AI doesn't know your ONE THING, it can't prioritize with you.
Write it once.
Use it daily.
Watch your output quality change.

## Short 3 - Learned Mistakes
Stop re-prompting forever.
Log mistakes as rules.
Mistake -> Rule -> Trigger.
That's how AI gets better every week.

## Short 4 - Morning Brief
If your day starts in inbox, you already lost.
Start with a brief:
ONE THING. 3 priorities. one thing to skip.

## Short 5 - Life OS
AI tools are not the edge.
A repeatable system is the edge.
One operating layer. Every domain.
