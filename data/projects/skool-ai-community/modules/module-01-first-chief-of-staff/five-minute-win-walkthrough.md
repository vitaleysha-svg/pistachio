# 5-Minute Win Walkthrough

## Goal
Get a personalized 3-step plan in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1 (60 seconds)
Open Claude.ai and start a new chat.

## Step 2 (90 seconds)
Paste this exactly:

```text
Act as my Chief of Staff.
I'm [NAME], I work in [ROLE].
My ONE THING this week is [GOAL].
My biggest challenge today is [CHALLENGE].

Give me:
1) The highest-ROI 3-step plan for today
2) The #1 thing I should not do today
3) One question you need to ask me to improve this plan

Keep it practical. No fluff. Use plain language.
```

## Step 3 (90 seconds)
Answer the follow-up question from Claude in one short paragraph.
Ask Claude to update the plan based on your answer.

## Step 4 (60 seconds)
Post in `#wins`:
- My ONE THING:
- My top 3 steps:
- What changed in my plan after follow-up:

## Step 5 (30 seconds)
Copy your plan into today's daily log file using `daily-log-template.md`.

## Done looks like
- You have a concrete plan for today.
- You avoided at least one low-value task.
- You can repeat this tomorrow in under 3 minutes.

## Real Example (Matt Style)
| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| ONE THING: build scriptwriter pipeline for Charlie | 3-step plan: shortlist refresh, personalized outreach, same-day follow-up stack |
| Constraint: low response rates from generic outreach | Added rule: no outreach without one deep-cut personalization line |
| Biggest challenge: too many moving pieces | Plan reduced to one daily loop: source -> outreach -> track -> close loop |

## Why this works
You are forcing clarity before action.
That removes noise and makes follow-through easier.
