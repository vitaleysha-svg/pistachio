# Installation Guide (Browser First)

This path is intentionally simple.
No terminal required for Day 1.

## Step 1
Create or open your Claude account in browser.

## Step 2
Create a folder on your computer called `my-chief-of-staff`.

## Step 3
Copy these starter files into that folder:
- `claude-md-template.md`
- `daily-log-template.md`

## Step 4
Run the 5-minute win from `five-minute-win-walkthrough.md`.

## Step 5
Post your win in the community.

## Optional Week 2 Upgrade (Claude Code)
If you want local workflow and persistent project files:
1. Install Node.js (LTS).
2. Install Claude Code CLI.
3. Open the `my-chief-of-staff` folder as your project.
4. Reuse the same templates.

If this feels heavy, stay browser-first until Module 3 is complete.
