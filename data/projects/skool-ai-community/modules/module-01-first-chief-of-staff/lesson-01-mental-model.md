# Lesson 01 - The Chief of Staff Mental Model

Most people use AI like a vending machine:
- Ask one question
- Get one answer
- Leave

That creates one-off outputs, not progress.

Your new model:
- AI is your Chief of Staff.
- A Chief of Staff tracks priorities, asks hard questions, and keeps you on plan.
- Your job is to give context and direction.
- AI's job is to organize, prioritize, and execute.

## Rule for this course
Never ask AI for a random answer when what you need is a decision or a next action.

Use this framing every time:
1. "Here is my goal."
2. "Here is my constraint."
3. "Give me the highest-value next steps."
4. "Ask me one question to improve this plan."

## Why this works
You stop asking for random answers and start running decision loops.
