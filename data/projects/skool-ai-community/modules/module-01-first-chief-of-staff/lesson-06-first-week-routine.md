# Lesson 06 - Your First Week Routine

Run this loop every day for 7 days:

## Morning (5-10 min)
1. State your ONE THING.
2. Ask Chief of Staff for 3-step plan.
3. Commit a start time.

## Midday (2 min)
1. Ask: "Am I still on the highest-value task?"
2. If no, ask for correction.

## Evening (5 min)
1. Log wins and blockers.
2. Ask for tomorrow's first move.

## End of week reflection prompt
```text
Review my week from these daily logs.
Find patterns in what helped and what hurt.
Give me 3 changes for next week.
```

## Why this works
Short loops beat long planning sessions.
