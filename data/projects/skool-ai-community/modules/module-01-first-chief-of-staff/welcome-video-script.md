If you've only used AI for random questions, you're about to feel a huge shift.

In this community, we're not treating AI like a search box.
We're treating it like a Chief of Staff.

That means it helps you prioritize your day, run your projects, and keep your goals in focus.

In the next 5 minutes, you're going to run one prompt and get a real action plan for today.
Not theory. Not fluff. A plan you can execute immediately.

Then you'll post your first win in the community so momentum starts now, not someday.

You don't need coding skills for this step.
You just need to follow instructions and be honest about your biggest challenge.

Let's do your first Chief of Staff moment right now.
