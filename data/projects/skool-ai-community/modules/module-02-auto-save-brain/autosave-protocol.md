# Auto-Save Protocol (Member Version)

## Rule
When a meaningful decision appears, save it before moving on.

## What counts as meaningful
- A decision
- A deadline
- A priority shift
- A blocker
- A lesson learned

## Where to save
- `goals.md` for priorities
- `patterns.md` for repeated behaviors
- `daily-log.md` for daily execution

## Prompt
```text
Before we continue, summarize what I just decided in 3 bullets.
Then tell me exactly where this should be saved (goals, patterns, or daily log).
```

## Weekly memory check
Every Friday ask:
```text
Review this week's logs and extract my top 5 repeat patterns.
For each pattern: keep, improve, or stop.
```
