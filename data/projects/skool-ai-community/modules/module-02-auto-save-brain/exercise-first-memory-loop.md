# Exercise - First Memory Loop

## Objective
Prove your Chief of Staff can remember and use yesterday's context.

## Steps
1. Write one concrete priority in today's log.
2. Ask Claude to create a 3-step plan.
3. End session.
4. Start a new session and ask:

```text
What was my top priority from yesterday and where did I get stuck?
Give me today's best continuation plan in 3 steps.
```

## Pass
