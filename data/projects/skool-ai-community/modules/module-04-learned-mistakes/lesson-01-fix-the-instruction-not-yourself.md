# Lesson 01 - Fix The Instruction, Not Yourself

Most people use AI like this:
1. Get weak output.
2. Get annoyed.
3. Re-prompt from scratch.

That loop never compounds.

Your loop is different:
1. Get weak output.
2. Name the exact mistake.
3. Add one permanent rule.
4. Re-run.

This is how your AI gets better without you repeating yourself forever.

## The Rule Format
Use this exact format:
- Mistake:
- Rule:
- Trigger:

Example:
- Mistake: Output sounded like corporate filler.
- Rule: Use short sentences and direct language. No AI fluff.
- Trigger: Any content draft for public posting.

## Why this works
You are changing system behavior, not chasing one-off answers.

## 5-minute rep
Take your last bad AI output and write one rule that would have prevented it.
