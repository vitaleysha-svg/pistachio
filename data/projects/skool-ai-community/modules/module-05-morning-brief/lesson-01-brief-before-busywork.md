# Lesson 01 - Brief Before Busywork

If you start your day in your inbox, you lost already.

Start with a brief.

A good brief does three things:
1. Names your ONE THING.
2. Shows your real constraints (time, meetings, blockers).
3. Gives you the next 3 actions in order.

## The trap
Most people write long plans and never execute.

## The fix
Short brief. Clear order. No extra work.

## The rule
Do not open Slack, email, or social before your morning brief is done.

## Source Anchors
- `AGENTS.md`
- `context/goals.md`
