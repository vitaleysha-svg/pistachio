# Lesson 01 - One System, Many Domains

Most people use AI as separate apps:
- one for writing
- one for research
- one for planning

That creates context switching and weak memory.

Use one system instead.

## The frame
Your AI is not a tool bucket.
It's your operating layer.

## Domain examples
1. Communication: drafts emails in your voice.
2. Decisions: gives options + tradeoffs.
3. Research: summarizes inputs into action.

## Core rule
Every domain workflow must answer:
- What input do I provide?
- What output do I need?
- What outcome should change?

If no outcome changes, it's just activity.
