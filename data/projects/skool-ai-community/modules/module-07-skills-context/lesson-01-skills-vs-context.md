# Lesson 01 - Skills vs Context

These are not the same thing.

## Skills
Reusable behavior packets.
Example: "When writing external emails, use plain text and short paragraphs."

## Context
Project-specific facts.
Example: "Charlie trial ends Feb 22."

## Why this matters
Without skills, AI output quality is inconsistent.
Without context, AI output is irrelevant.

You need both.

## Operating rule
- Skills answer: how to do the work.
- Context answers: what this specific work is about.

## Source Anchors
