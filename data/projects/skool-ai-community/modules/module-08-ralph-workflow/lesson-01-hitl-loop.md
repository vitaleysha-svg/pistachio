# Lesson 01 - Human In The Loop, Not Human As Bottleneck

Autonomy is not "run forever and pray."

It is a controlled loop:
1. Define scope.
2. Execute.
3. Verify.
4. Decide next loop.

## The failure pattern
People skip scope and verification.
Then they get activity, not outcomes.

## The Ralph rule
No loop is complete without:
- artifact
- evidence
- next action

## Minimum safe controls
- timebox the run
- explicit do-not-touch rules
- kill switch conditions

## Source Anchors
