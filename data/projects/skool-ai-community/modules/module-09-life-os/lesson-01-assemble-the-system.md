# Lesson 01 - Assemble The System

A Life OS is not a notes folder.

It is a behavior system:
- context is saved
- priorities are visible
- loops get closed

## Required layers
1. Identity + goals
2. Daily execution log
3. Project-specific context
4. Learned mistakes

If one layer is missing, quality drops fast.

## Key principle
The value is compounding memory plus clear priorities.

## Source Anchors
- `context/goals.md`
- `context/patterns.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
