# Life OS File Architecture (Starter)

## Root
- `CLAUDE.md` - how the AI should operate
- `AGENTS.md` - procedures and cadence
- `SOUL.md` - role definition and decision posture
- `USER.md` - personal context

## Context
- `context/goals.md`
- `context/patterns.md`
- `context/projects/<project>.md`

## Daily
- `data/daily-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Projects
- `data/projects/<project-name>/`
  - plan
  - execution log
  - handoff

## Quality
- `.claude/skills/learned-mistakes/SKILL.md`

## Rule
If context isn't stored in files, it doesn't exist operationally.

## Source Anchors
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
