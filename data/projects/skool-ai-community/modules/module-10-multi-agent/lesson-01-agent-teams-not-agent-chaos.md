# Lesson 01 - Agent Teams, Not Agent Chaos

More agents does not mean better output.

You only get scaling when:
1. each agent has a clear role
2. scope is non-overlapping
3. one reviewer owns quality gate

## Minimal structure
- Builder: creates the first draft/artifact.
- Reviewer: checks facts, scope, and quality.
- Operator (you): decides final ship/no-ship.

## Common failure
Two agents doing the same task with no merge protocol.

## Fix
Use explicit assignments and a single final decision owner.
