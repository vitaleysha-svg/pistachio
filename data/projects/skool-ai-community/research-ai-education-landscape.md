**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Purpose:** Competitive landscape analysis for Matt's Skool AI community targeting non-technical users

---

## 1. Top AI Communities and Courses for Non-Technical Users

### Skool-Based Communities

**Liam Ottley -- AI Automation Agency Hub**
- **Platform:** Skool
- **Members:** 111,000+ (free tier); 289,000+ total reach
- **Free tier:** Weekly live Q&A, 50+ templates (contracts, proposals, sales scripts), peer networking
- **Paid tier (AAA Accelerator):** $1,500--$2,000 one-time; 8 core modules, 60+ hours of video, weekly live Q&A, private coaching calls
- **Promise:** Build an AI automation agency. Revenue-focused. "Get clients and make money with AI."
- **Gap:** Entirely business/agency focused. Zero lifestyle integration. Zero "use AI to think better." Technical audience (building for clients, not for self).

**AI Automation Society (Skool)**
- **Platform:** Skool
- **Focus:** No-code AI automations
- **Promise:** "Learn, discuss, and build the systems that will shape the future of work"
- **Positioning:** Community-driven learning for AI automation builders

**Nick Saraev -- Maker School**
- **Platform:** Skool (2,600+ members)
- **Price:** $184/month (rising to $204/month)
- **Content:** 218+ video lessons across 90 days, Make.com and n8n templates, daily Q&A with personalized Loom video responses, weekly live coaching
- **Promise:** Get your first paying AI automation client within 90 days (money-back guarantee)
- **Gap:** Pure agency play. Technical (Make.com, n8n). Not personal productivity or life integration.

### Non-Skool Platforms

**Tiago Forte -- Building a Second Brain**
- **Platform:** Own site + cohort-based + Notion ecosystem
- **Price:** Varies by cohort ($1,500+ for live cohort historically)
- **Members/Reach:** 400,000 book copies sold worldwide
- **2026 pivot:** Officially going AI-first. Planning new cohort-based program for professionals, freelancers, creators, and executives adopting AI deeply. Pivoting membership to AI-centric.
- **Gap:** Still rooted in note-taking/PKM. Not teaching Claude Code or CLI tools. Not "10 hours a day with AI." Framework-heavy, tool-light.

**Andrew Ng -- AI For Everyone (Coursera)**
- **Platform:** Coursera
- **Price:** Free (with paid certificate option)
- **Duration:** ~6 hours
- **Promise:** Non-technical overview of AI for business leaders and managers
- **Gap:** Academic. Conceptual only. Zero hands-on tool usage. No community.

**Google AI Essentials**
- **Platform:** Grow with Google
- **Price:** Free
- **Promise:** Practical AI skills for any role, no technical experience needed
- **Gap:** Generic. Google-tool centric. No depth. No community.

**Elements of AI (University of Helsinki)**
- **Platform:** Own site
- **Price:** Free
- **Promise:** Make AI understandable for everyone without math or programming
- **Gap:** Academic fundamentals. No workflow integration. No ongoing community.

### Claude-Specific Courses

**Anthropic Academy -- Claude Code in Action**
- **Platform:** Skilljar / Coursera (free)
- **Released:** January 2026
- **Content:** 21 structured lessons from basics to advanced. Covers GitHub integration, hooks, SDK concepts.

**Claude Code for Everyone (ccforeveryone.com)**
- **Platform:** Thinkific (free)
- **Creator:** Carl Vellotti (independent, not Anthropic)
- **Content:** File operations, visual workspace, parallel agents, custom sub-agents, project memory, commands and shortcuts
- **Promise:** "Learn AI by actually doing it -- no videos, no docs, no coding experience required"
- **Gap:** Free resource, no community model. Teaches tool mechanics, not the meta-system or daily integration. No monetization path.

**Udemy -- Claude Code Beginner Crash Course**
- **Platform:** Udemy
- **Price:** ~$20--$80 (Udemy pricing)
- **Promise:** Learn Claude Code in a day, ship a project
- **Gap:** One-shot course. No community. No ongoing support. Developer-flavored.

### AI YouTube Educators (Community Adjacent)

**Matt Wolfe (FutureTools.io)**
- 580K+ YouTube subscribers. AI news, tool reviews, practical applications
- AI Playbook product for entrepreneurs
- Accessible to non-technical audiences but no deep teaching community

**Wes Roth**

## 2. What They're Teaching

### The Standard AI Education Curriculum (2025--2026)

| Category | What's Taught | Who's Teaching It | Depth |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| ChatGPT Prompting | Prompt engineering, system prompts, chain-of-thought | Everyone (Coursera, Udemy, YouTube) | Shallow to medium |
| AI Automation (No-Code) | Make.com, Zapier, n8n workflows | Liam Ottley, Nick Saraev, Maker School | Medium-deep |
| AI Agency Building | Client acquisition, service delivery, pricing | AAA Accelerator, Maker School | Business-deep |
| Vibe Coding | Building apps with Cursor, Bolt, Lovable, v0 | Udemy courses, YouTube tutorials | Technical-medium |
| AI for Business Leaders | Concepts, strategy, implementation planning | Andrew Ng, Google, UC Berkeley | Conceptual only |
| PKM + AI | Second Brain + AI integration, Notion AI | Tiago Forte (pivoting 2026) | Framework-deep, tool-shallow |
| Claude Code Specifically | CLI usage, agentic coding, project setup | Anthropic Academy, ccforeveryone.com, Udemy | Technical, developer-oriented |

### What Nobody Is Teaching

1. **Claude Code as a non-technical daily driver** -- Every Claude Code course assumes developer context
2. **AI Chief of Staff / Life OS** -- The concept of a persistent AI partner that knows your goals, patterns, and projects
3. **10-hour daily AI integration** -- Nobody is showing what it looks like to live inside AI tools all day
4. **Meta-system thinking** -- "How to think with AI" vs "how to prompt AI"
5. **Personal operating system powered by AI** -- Life OS, daily logs, pattern recognition, psycho-cybernetics integration
6. **Vertical application across life domains** -- Using the same AI system for recruiting, email, idea generation, therapy, content creation, personality analysis
7. **Progressive non-technical CLI onboarding** -- Teaching terminal to someone who has never seen one, specifically for Claude Code

---

## 3. The Gap in the Market

### Where Existing Courses Stop

```
Level 1: "What is AI?" (Andrew Ng, Google)           <-- Everyone starts here
Level 2: "Prompt ChatGPT better" (100+ courses)      <-- Saturated
Level 3: "Automate workflows" (Zapier/Make courses)   <-- Growing, still tool-specific
Level 4: "Build an AI agency" (Liam Ottley, Nick S.)  <-- Revenue-focused niche
Level 5: "Vibe code an app" (Cursor/Bolt courses)     <-- Technical, project-based
```

### Where Matt's Community Would Start

```
Level 6: "AI as your Chief of Staff"                  <-- NOBODY IS HERE
Level 7: "Life OS -- persistent AI operating system"   <-- NOBODY IS HERE
Level 8: "Claude Code for non-technical daily use"    <-- NOBODY IS HERE
Level 9: "10-hour daily AI integration across life"   <-- NOBODY IS HERE
Level 10: "Meta-system for thinking, not just doing"  <-- NOBODY IS HERE
```

### Specific Gaps Identified

**Gap 1: Claude Code for non-developers is a ghost town.**
The "Claude Code for Everyone" free course by Carl Vellotti exists but has no community model, no monetization, no ongoing engagement. Anthropic's own course is developer-centric. There is no paid community teaching non-technical people to use Claude Code as a daily tool. This is wide open.

**Gap 2: Nobody teaches "living inside AI" as a lifestyle.**
Microsoft defines an "AI Power User" as someone saving 30+ minutes per day. Matt's model is 10+ hours per day. The gap between "I use ChatGPT sometimes" and "AI is my operating system" has zero educational products filling it.

**Gap 3: The "Second Brain" crowd is stuck in notes.**
Tiago Forte is pivoting to AI-first in 2026, but his framework is still rooted in note-taking (PARA, CODE). Matt's Life OS is a fundamentally different paradigm: the AI is not a note-taking tool, it is a thinking partner with persistent context, goals, and pattern recognition.

**Gap 4: No course bridges "scared of terminal" to "power CLI user."**
Every Claude Code resource assumes you know what a terminal is. The on-ramp from "I've never seen a command line" to "I have 14 GitHub projects" does not exist in any structured educational product.

**Gap 5: Vertical application is missing everywhere.**
Existing courses teach ONE thing (prompting, automation, agency building). Nobody shows the same system applied to recruiting, email, idea generation, personality analysis, content creation, therapy, and career development -- all from one AI relationship.

## 4. Positioning Analysis

### Current Market Positioning Categories

| Positioning | Examples | Promise | Problem |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| "Make money with AI" | Liam Ottley, Nick Saraev | Revenue, clients, agency | Attracts get-rich-quick crowd. High churn. Hollow. |
| "Learn AI fundamentals" | Andrew Ng, Google | Understanding | Too academic. No action. Low retention. |
| "Productivity hack" | Zapier, generic courses | Save time | Commodity. Everyone says this. Race to bottom. |
| "Build apps without code" | Cursor/Bolt courses | Ship a product | Project-based, not lifestyle. One and done. |
| "Second Brain + AI" | Tiago Forte | Organize knowledge | Framework-heavy. Still note-taking. |

### Recommended Positioning: "AI Operating System for Your Life"

This sits outside all existing categories. It is not about money, not about productivity hacks, not about building apps. It is about fundamentally upgrading how you think and operate.

**Core message:** "You're still using AI like a search engine. We'll show you how to use it as a Chief of Staff."

**Why this works for non-technical audiences:**
1. "Chief of Staff" is a universally understood metaphor -- everyone knows what an executive assistant does
2. It promises transformation of daily life, not just work
3. It is aspirational without being "get rich quick"
4. It positions the community as premium and differentiated
5. It allows infinite vertical expansion (every domain of life)

**Positioning matrix:**

```
                    TOOL-SPECIFIC ←————————→ META-SYSTEM
                         |                       |
    MONEY-FOCUSED    [Ottley]                    |
                     [Saraev]                    |
                         |                       |
                         |                       |
    LIFE-FOCUSED     [Zapier]              [MATT'S COMMUNITY]
                     [Forte*]              "AI Chief of Staff"
                         |                       |
                         |                       |
    * Forte pivoting toward this space in 2026
```

### Positioning Risks

- "Meta-system" can sound abstract. Need concrete demonstrations (the 5-minute win).
- Non-technical audience might not understand value until they experience it. Video/live demos critical.
- "Chief of Staff" resonates more with professionals/executives than with younger demographics. May need dual messaging.

## 5. What's Working in 2025--2026 AI Education

### Market Size

- **AI in Education market:** $7--8.3B in 2025, projected $32--112B by 2030--2034 (CAGR 31--43%)
- **Overall e-learning market:** ~$320B in 2025, reaching $336--400B by 2026
- **Online course creator economy:** Top Skool communities generating $3,400 to $335,000/month

### Platform Trends

**Skool is dominant for community-first courses:**
- $99/month flat fee for creators, 0% platform fees
- 40% free communities, 60% paid
- Average paid community: $376.77/month pricing
- Gamification (points, levels, leaderboards) drives 2x engagement vs free communities
- Skool Games leaderboard creates competitive motivation among community owners
- Top 15 free communities have 1.7M+ members combined, AI/Automation is 4 of top 15

**Discord for scale, Skool for conversion:**
- Discord: 40,000+ creators using Community Subscriptions by mid-2025; $3--10/month average
- Skool: Higher revenue per member, better for premium ($97+/month) communities
- LaunchPass enables paid Slack/Discord/Telegram communities

**Pricing sweet spots (Skool data):**
- $1--10/month: Highest engagement (1.71%), 2x that of free
- $47--97/month: Standard premium community range
- $97--297/month: High-value communities with live coaching
- $500--10,000/month: Ultra-premium, small exclusive groups (200--1,200 members)

### Format Trends

1. **Hybrid cohort + self-paced is winning.** Self-paced alone: 3% completion rates. Cohort-based: 85--90% completion. The trend is blending both.
2. **Community-first, content-second.** The shift from "buy my course" to "join my community" is accelerating. Skool's model (community with course inside) outperforms traditional course platforms.
3. **Live calls are the retention mechanism.** Skool Call (native live sessions) is the standout feature of 2026. Daily/weekly calls dramatically reduce churn.
4. **Short video modules (5--10 minutes) with progressive unlocking.** Keep attention high. Don't dump 60 hours of content on someone.
5. **"Vibe coding" is mainstream.** Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025. Non-technical people building apps with AI is no longer niche; it is a cultural movement. 250,000+ users on some platforms.

### Revenue Benchmarks

## 6. Course Design Principles for Non-Technical Audiences

### The Terminal/CLI On-Ramp Problem

Non-technical users have never seen a terminal. They don't know what `cd`, `ls`, or `git` mean. Claude Code lives in the terminal. This is the single biggest barrier.

**Progressive complexity model:**

```
Week 1: "Open this app, type this exact thing, see what happens"
  - Install Claude Code (guided screenshare or video with exact clicks)
  - Type one command: "claude" + press Enter
  - Have first conversation with Claude Code
  - WIN: "I just talked to an AI in my terminal"

Week 2: "Tell it what you want"
  - Natural language requests inside Claude Code
  - "Write me an email to [person] about [topic]"
  - "Summarize this document"
  - WIN: "AI did something useful for me in 30 seconds"

Week 3: "Your first project"
  - Create a folder, create a file, edit it with Claude
  - Basic file system concepts (folders = drawers, files = papers)
  - WIN: "I have a project folder with stuff AI made for me"

Week 4: "AI remembers you"
  - CLAUDE.md files and project memory
  - "Tell Claude who you are and what you care about"
  - WIN: "AI knows my context now. This is different."

Weeks 5--8: "Build your Life OS"
  - Progressive system building
  - Each module adds one capability
  - WIN: "I have a Chief of Staff"
```

### Teaching Principles from Successful Non-Technical Courses

**1. Show, don't explain.**
- Live screenshare > documentation
- "Watch me do this" > "Here's how it works"
- Matt's 10-hour daily sessions ARE the content

**2. Outcome-based module design (Hormozi framework).**
- Hormozi's equation: (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay + Effort)
- Every module must have a tangible outcome: "By the end of this module, you will have [specific thing]"
- AI is binary -- it works or it doesn't. Easy to demonstrate outcomes.

**3. Remove all unnecessary complexity.**
- Don't teach git until they need git
- Don't explain APIs until they ask
- Don't mention tokens, models, or parameters
- Metaphors: Terminal = "your AI's office", Commands = "instructions", Files = "documents"

**4. Peer support is non-negotiable.**
- Non-technical users get stuck on installation, permissions, and configuration
- Community Q&A and buddy system prevent frustration dropout
- Live calls where people can screenshare their problems

**5. Gamification drives completion.**
- Skool's point/level system: 1 like = 1 point, levels unlock content
- Customize level names to community theme ("Intern" -> "Chief of Staff" -> "AI Architect")
- Monthly leaderboard contests triple daily post counts (2--3/day to 8--10/day)
- Milestone rewards for completing modules

**6. Video length: 5--10 minutes maximum.**
- Non-technical users have low patience for long tutorials
- One concept per video
- Always end with an action: "Now you try it"

---

## 7. The "5-Minute Win" for AI Courses

### Why This Matters

A 10--15 minute first session that achieves a specific goal lifts Day 1 and Day 7 retention measurably. Self-paced courses have 3% completion rates. The first 5 minutes determine whether someone stays.

### What Other Courses Do for First Wins

| Course | First Win | Time to Win |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| ChatGPT prompting courses | "Ask ChatGPT something cool" | 2 minutes |
| Zapier automation courses | "Connect two apps" | 15 minutes |
| Liam Ottley AAA Hub | "Watch intro video, join community" | 5 minutes |
| Tiago Forte BASB | "Capture your first note" | 10 minutes |
| Cursor vibe coding | "Generate a landing page" | 10 minutes |

### 5-Minute Win Designs for Matt's Community

**Option A: "Meet Your Chief of Staff" (Recommended)**
1. Member signs up (0:00)
2. Watches 90-second video: "You're about to meet your AI Chief of Staff" (0:00--1:30)
3. Opens Claude.ai (not Code yet -- lower barrier) (1:30--2:00)
4. Pastes a pre-written prompt: "Act as my Chief of Staff. I'm [name], I work in [field]. My biggest challenge right now is [X]. Give me a 3-step action plan for today." (2:00--3:00)
5. Gets personalized action plan from Claude (3:00--4:00)
6. Posts result in community with "My first Chief of Staff moment" tag (4:00--5:00)
7. **WIN: "Holy shit, this is different from how I've been using ChatGPT."**

**Option B: "AI Writes Your Bio" (Lighter)**
1. Paste a prompt that generates a professional bio, LinkedIn summary, or email signature
2. Immediate tangible output they can use TODAY
3. Shows AI doing something personal and useful in under 3 minutes

**Option C: "Your Morning Brief" (Daily Hook)**
1. Pre-built prompt template: "Give me my morning brief based on [calendar/goals/priorities]"
2. Member gets a personalized daily brief
3. Creates daily return habit from day one
4. Leads naturally into "wouldn't it be cool if AI remembered this automatically?" (bridge to Claude Code)

**Option D: "The Life Audit" (High Impact)**
1. Structured prompt that asks Claude to help audit their current productivity, goals, and time allocation
2. AI produces a personalized "State of Your Life" document
3. Immediately reveals the gap between where they are and what's possible with AI
4. Creates urgency and motivation to go deeper

### The Bridge to Claude Code

The 5-minute win should happen in Claude.ai (browser, zero friction). The community then progressively bridges to Claude Code:

```
Day 1: Win in Claude.ai (browser)
Week 1: "What if AI could do this automatically?"
Week 2: "Install Claude Code (we'll walk you through it)"
Week 3: "Your first Claude Code session"
Week 4: "AI that remembers everything about you"
Month 2: "Building your Life OS"
```

---

## 8. Competitive Summary and Strategic Recommendations

### Matt's Unfair Advantages

1. **Proof of concept.** 14 GitHub projects, 10-hour daily sessions, Life OS running live. This is not theoretical.
2. **Content machine.** Everything Matt does is content. No separate "content creation" workload.
3. **Non-technical teaching ability.** The vision notes explicitly target people like Matt's dad (50s+). This empathy is rare in AI education.
4. **Vertical diversity.** Recruiting, email, idea generation, personality analysis, career, therapy, content creation -- all from one system. No competitor covers this range.
5. **Claude Code depth.** Top 1% of 1% user. Nobody else in the education space has this level of practical expertise with Claude Code specifically.

### Strategic Recommendations

**Price:** Start at $39/month, escalating per the vision notes. The Skool data supports this: $47--97/month is the sweet spot for premium communities. $39 as entry point with escalation to $97 hits the optimal zone.

**Platform:** Skool is the right choice. Community-first model, gamification, native live calls, $99/month flat fee. No competitors offer this combination.

**Format:** Hybrid. Short self-paced video modules (5--10 min each) + daily live calls for first 100 members + community Q&A. This maps to the 85--90% completion rate model.

**Differentiation messaging:** "Stop prompting. Start thinking with AI." or "From ChatGPT to Chief of Staff."

**Content cadence:** Matt posts everything he does daily (already in the plan). This is the exact model that works on Skool -- the creator IS the content.

**Revenue path to $100K/month:**
- At $39/month: Need 2,564 members
- At $67/month (after 140 members): Need 1,493 members
- At $97/month (cap): Need 1,031 members
- Blended average ~$65/month: Need ~1,538 members
- Dan Henry does $116K/month with 1,200 members at $97/month

### Timing

Tiago Forte is pivoting to AI-first in 2026. The "Claude Code for Everyone" free course just launched. Anthropic released their official course in January 2026. The market is waking up to this space. The window to establish the premium, community-based, non-technical Claude Code education brand is open now but will narrow as more players enter.
