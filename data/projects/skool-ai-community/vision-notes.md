# Skool AI Community — Matt's Vision Notes
Captured: 2026-02-12 from live conversation

## The Idea
Skool community teaching non-technical people how to use Claude Code/Codex the way Matt does (top 1% of 1%). Make normies 3x more productive across any vertical.

## Target Audience (Two Avatars)
1. **Older people (50s+)** — like Matt's dad. If we can simplify AI to this level, massive market. Older people have money, patience, and real problems to solve.
2. **Younger people** — non-technical, haven't figured out AI beyond ChatGPT/Perplexity. Different energy but same need.

Both are NON-TECHNICAL. This is not for developers. This is for your average person who doesn't know what a terminal is.

## Pricing Strategy
- Start at $39/month
- Every 50 members, price goes up $10/month
- Cap at $97/month
- Explore: free tier with upsell to $40/month (Skool has tiered functionality)
- Need to research Skool pricing best practices, recent Skool videos, and their YouTube course on community building

## Revenue Target
$100K/month. "I can see this doing 100K a month easily."

## The Immediate Win (5-Minute Dopamine Hit)
THE critical design question: how does someone get a win within 5 minutes of signing up?
- Life OS / Chief of Staff system = immediate value. "Every person needs a Chief of Staff in their life the way I use you."
- Unlike Dream Job program where it takes a week to see anything — this needs to be instant.
- AI is deterministic — it either works or it doesn't. Binary. Easy to show immediate results.

## Core Positioning
**Meta-system, not a money-making course.**
- "This is going to uplevel your ability and teach you the unknown unknowns"
- "People are still using Perplexity and ChatGPT. This is a whole different level."
- "Teach people how to think like a senior software engineer as the world moves away from coding toward needing good ideas and knowing how to use AI in everything."
- NOT "pay us and you'll make more money" — it's "learn how to really think and use these tools, and it will be different for each person"
- It STARTS with the Chief of Staff / Life OS system

## Matt's Verticals (What He Can Teach Through AI)
1. Master recruiter — hiring vertical
2. Making money — business vertical
3. Sending emails — communication vertical
4. Idea generation — creative vertical
5. Working with YouTubers — creator economy vertical
6. Personality analysis — self-awareness vertical
7. Resume/job landing — career vertical
8. Therapy/thinking better — personal development vertical

## Community Model (High-Touch)
- Daily calls for first 100 members
- Private WhatsApp group for first 100
- Telegram group
- OpenClaw setup for people
- Matt posting constantly — everything he's working on IS the content
- "Literally live, here's what I'm doing, here's how it applies to you"

## Content Creation
- Matt can make 10 videos, 10 shorts a day easily
- Everything he already works on = content for the community
- His 10-hour daily Claude sessions = live demonstrations

## Business Partner
Vitaliy — Matt gave him Life OS. Will be involved.

## Tech Stack Insight
From Matt's actual usage:
- 14 GitHub projects built with Claude Code
- Life OS as persistent AI operating system
- Claude Code (CLI) as primary tool
- Codex for autonomous tasks
- Next.js dashboards
- Multiple data systems

## Course Design Principles (from Dream Job redesign)
- Grant's 5-step formula: every module has direct outcomes
- "How do you know you're getting better?"
- With AI it's easy — binary, deterministic, it works or it doesn't

## MVP Timeline
3 days of human time:
- Day 1: Plan everything to the T — VSL, community operations, MVP program
- Day 2-3: Build and launch

## What Codex Needs to Research
1. Skool best practices — pricing, community structure, recent Skool videos (hour-long), their YouTube course
2. Successful AI communities — what's working, pricing, structure
3. Course design principles — immediate value, outcome-based modules
4. Extract Matt's usage patterns from 14 GitHub repos
5. Productize Life OS for non-technical users
6. Dream Job program structure (Grant's 5-step formula)

## Key Insight
"We have such a rich knowledge base of everything I've ever done, all my voice notes, even the way I analyze my personality and IQ. These are all separate products within this potentially."
