## Launch Strategy: Stealth-to-Monetize (Vitaley Decision - 2026-02-06)

**Phase 1: Stealth Mode (Week 1-2)**
- Post on Instagram and TikTok with NO Fanvue link
- Make the account look as real/organic as possible
- Goal: Build initial followers who believe she's a real person
- No monetization links, no "link in bio" to paid content
- Focus purely on engagement, relatability, authenticity
- Content should feel like a normal girl posting her life

**Phase 2: Flip to Professional (Week 3+)**
- Once follower base is established and engagement is proven
- Switch to professional/creator account
- Add Fanvue link to bio
- Start ManyChat DM automation
- Begin monetization funnels

**Why this works:**
- Early followers have no reason to suspect AI = stronger initial engagement
- Algorithm rewards authentic-looking accounts with organic reach
- Built-in social proof by the time link drops ("she's been posting for weeks")
- Avoids the "obvious AI monetization" red flag that kills new accounts
- First impressions matter - if day 1 has a paywall link, people bounce

## Content Pillars

1. **Bored/Lonely** - Relatable gaming girl vibes
2. **Teasing** - Suggestive but not explicit on IG
3. **Personal** - "Authentic" moments
4. **Interactive** - Questions, polls, engagement bait

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Reach | 1.5-3x followers |
| Engagement Rate | 8-12% |
| Profile Clicks | TBD |
| Link Clicks | TBD |
