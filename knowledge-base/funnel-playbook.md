### Warning: Avoid Getting Banned

- Don't over-automate (mix with human interaction)
- Stay within Instagram ToS
- No explicit content in DMs
- Vary message templates (don't spam identical messages)
- Monitor analytics and adjust

## Pre-Lander Strategy

### What Makes a Good Pre-Lander

1. **Teaser content** - Blur or preview of what's inside
2. **Social proof** - Subscriber count, testimonials
3. **Scarcity/urgency** - Limited spots, special offer
4. **Clear CTA** - One button, one action
5. **Mobile-optimized** - 80%+ traffic is mobile

### Pre-Lander Template Structure

```
[Header Image - Censored Preview]

"Join [X] others who already subscribed..."

✨ What you get:
- Daily exclusive content
- Direct messages with me
- Special requests available
- Behind the scenes

🔥 Limited time: First month 50% off

[SUBSCRIBE NOW - $10/month]

"Can't wait to see you inside 💕"
```

### A/B Tests to Run

1. **Pricing:** $9.99 vs $14.99 vs $19.99
2. **Discount:** 50% off first month vs no discount
3. **Preview:** Blurred vs black bars vs no preview
4. **CTA text:** "Subscribe" vs "Join Me" vs "Get Access"
5. **Testimonials:** With vs without

## Pricing Strategy

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Target |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Base | $9.99/mo | Daily posts, DM access | Volume |
| Standard | $19.99/mo | + Weekly exclusives, customs | Balance |
| Premium | $49.99/mo | + Priority, video calls (fake), special | Whales |

### PPV Strategy

- $5-15 per photo set
- $15-50 per video
- Custom requests: $50-200+
- Tip-for-reveal in posts

**Top earners make 50%+ of revenue from PPV/customs, not subscriptions.**

## Conversion Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Profile visit → Link click | 10-20% | IG analytics |
| Link click → Pre-lander view | 80%+ | Pre-lander analytics |
| Pre-lander → Subscribe | 5-15% | Fanvue/OF dashboard |
| DM → Link click | 20-40% | ManyChat analytics |
| Overall funnel | 2-5% | End-to-end tracking |

## Platform Choice: Fanvue vs OnlyFans

| Factor | Fanvue | OnlyFans |
|--------|--------|----------|
| AI policy | Explicitly welcomes AI | Ambiguous, risky |
| Platform cut | 20% | 20% |
| Discovery | Better internal discovery | Minimal |
| Payout | Weekly | Weekly |
| Brand | Growing, AI-friendly | Established, saturated |

**RECOMMENDATION:** Start on Fanvue. AI-friendly, less risk of ban.
