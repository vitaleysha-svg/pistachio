### Warning: Avoid Getting Banned

- Don't over-automate (mix with human interaction)
- Stay within Instagram ToS
- No explicit content in DMs
- Vary message templates (don't spam identical messages)
- Monitor analytics and adjust

## Pre-Lander Strategy

### What Makes a Good Pre-Lander

1. **Teaser content** - Blur or preview of what's inside
2. **Social proof** - Subscriber count, testimonials
3. **Scarcity/urgency** - Limited spots, special offer
4. **Clear CTA** - One button, one action
5. **Mobile-optimized** - 80%+ traffic is mobile

### Pre-Lander Template Structure

```
[Header Image - Censored Preview]

"Join [X] others who already subscribed..."

✨ What you get:
- Daily exclusive content
- Direct messages with me
- Special requests available
- Behind the scenes

🔥 Limited time: First month 50% off

[SUBSCRIBE NOW - $10/month]

"Can't wait to see you inside 💕"
```

### A/B Tests to Run

1. **Pricing:** $9.99 vs $14.99 vs $19.99
2. **Discount:** 50% off first month vs no discount
3. **Preview:** Blurred vs black bars vs no preview
4. **CTA text:** "Subscribe" vs "Join Me" vs "Get Access"
5. **Testimonials:** With vs without

## Pricing Strategy

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Target |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Base | $9.99/mo | Daily posts, DM access | Volume |
| Standard | $19.99/mo | + Weekly exclusives, customs | Balance |
| Premium | $49.99/mo | + Priority, video calls (fake), special | Whales |

### PPV Strategy

- $5-15 per photo set
- $15-50 per video
- Custom requests: $50-200+
- Tip-for-reveal in posts

**Top earners make 50%+ of revenue from PPV/customs, not subscriptions.**

## Conversion Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Profile visit → Link click | 10-20% | IG analytics |
| Link click → Pre-lander view | 80%+ | Pre-lander analytics |
| Pre-lander → Subscribe | 5-15% | Fanvue/OF dashboard |
| DM → Link click | 20-40% | ManyChat analytics |
| Overall funnel | 2-5% | End-to-end tracking |

## Platform Choice: Fanvue vs OnlyFans vs Patreon (Updated 2026-02-06)

| Factor | Fanvue | OnlyFans | Patreon |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Platform cut** | **15%** | 20% | 5-12% |
| **AI policy** | Explicitly welcomes AI | Ambiguous - could ban | No explicit/suggestive content allowed |
| **Payout** | Bi-weekly | Weekly | Monthly |
| **Discovery** | Better internal discovery | Minimal | Minimal |
| **Content type** | Adult/suggestive OK | Adult/suggestive OK | SFW only - strict policy |
| **Audience size** | Growing, smaller | Largest, established | Large but wrong audience |
| **Link suppression** | Less suppressed on IG/TikTok | IG/TikTok actively suppress OF links | Not suppressed |
| **Risk** | Low (built for AI) | High (AI TOS unclear, could ban) | High (content policy kills monetization model) |

**RECOMMENDATION:** Fanvue is the move because:
1. **Explicitly allows AI creators** - no TOS risk of account ban
2. **15% cut vs OF's 20%** = $5K more per $100K revenue
3. **OF could detect and ban AI content** - ambiguous policy, not worth the risk
4. **Patreon is a non-starter** - their content policy prohibits the suggestive content that drives 80%+ of revenue in this space
5. **15%+ of Fanvue revenue already comes from AI creators** - the platform is built for us

**Kill shot:** Patreon's lowest cut (5%) is meaningless if you can't post the content that converts. OF's bigger audience is meaningless if they ban you. Fanvue is the only platform where you're a WELCOMED customer, not a liability.
