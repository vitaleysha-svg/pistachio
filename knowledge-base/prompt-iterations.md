# Prompt Iteration Log

> Every iteration makes the system smarter. Never delete entries - they're training data.

## How to Use This Log

Each iteration entry captures the full loop:
1. Reference image description
2. Decomposition (what Claude saw)
3. Prompt generated
4. Output result (what MJ/ComfyUI produced)
5. User feedback (what's right, what's wrong)
6. Adjustments made
7. Pattern extracted (reusable learning)

## Extracted Patterns (Compounds Over Time)

<!-- Add patterns here as they're discovered. Format: -->
<!-- - **[PATTERN NAME]**: [What works / what to avoid] -->

*No patterns yet - first iteration pending.*
