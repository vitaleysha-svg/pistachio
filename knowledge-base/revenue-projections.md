## Fanvue Market Reality (Math)

- Fanvue $100M annualized run rate (Jan 2026) = their 20% cut
- Total GMV (subscriber spending): $500M/year
- Total creator earnings: $400M/year
- 250,000 creators on platform, 17M monthly active users
- Average creator: $133/month (but averages are useless - power law distribution)
- Top 1% (2,500 creators): $5K-50K/mo, ~40% of revenue
- Top 10% (22,500): $1K-5K/mo, ~35% of revenue
- Active middle (75,000): $100-500/mo, ~20% of revenue
- Bottom/inactive (150,000): $0-50/mo, ~5% of revenue
- FLOOR for active creators who actually post: $50-100/mo
- Active creator average (strips out dead accounts): ~$317/month

## Gun-to-Head Timeline (Accelerated - No Stealth Phase)

Only 1 real bottleneck: pipeline face consistency (needs 9/10).
Everything else is same-day setup.

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 1-3 | Dial in pipeline to 9/10 |
| Day 3-4 | Generate 30+ images (2-3 hour batch session) |
| Day 4 | Set up Fanvue + Instagram + TikTok, link in bio Day 1 |
| Day 5-30 | Post 2-3x/day, generate more batches, add video |

Revenue starts Week 2, not Month 4.

- Fanvue cut: 20% (creators keep 80%)
- Net per subscriber: $7.99/mo
- Monthly subscriber churn: 12% (high - industry average is 8-10%)
- Instagram growth: slow, organic only, no paid ads
- Conversion rate (followers to subscribers): 1% (low end of 1-3% range)
- Tips/PPV revenue: 15% of subscription revenue (conservative - some creators see 30-50%)
- No brand deals counted in Year 1
- Only Channel 1 (Fanvue). Channels 2 and 3 not included.
- Monthly tool costs: $79/mo (full stack)

## What's NOT Included (Intentionally Excluded Upside)

| Source | Why Excluded | Realistic Addition |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Higher sub price ($14.99-19.99) | Using $9.99 to be safe | +50-100% on all numbers |
| Brand deals / sponsorships | Unpredictable | $500-2K/deal at 10K+ followers |
| Channel 2: B2B content service | Not Year 1 | $1K-5K/mo once launched |
| Channel 3: AI avatars for businesses | Not Year 1 | $500-2K/client |
| Multiple AI personas | Only counting 1 | Each new persona = new stream |
| Custom content requests | Hard to predict | 20-40% of revenue for some creators |
| Lower churn (8% vs 12%) | Using worst case | 30-40% more subs by M12 |

## Market Validation

- Entry-level AI creators (50-75 subs): $750-1,500/mo
- Established creators (200+ subs): $3,000-8,000/mo
- Top AI influencers (50K-100K followers): $5,000-15,000/mo
- Fanvue: $100M annualized revenue, 17M MAU, 250K creators
- Fanvue raised $22M Series A in January 2026
- Our conservative Y1 ending ($1,149/mo) is BELOW entry-level benchmarks

## Break-Even Analysis

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Break-Even |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Budget ($10/mo) | $10 | Month 4 (2 subs) |
| Standard ($79/mo) | $79 | Month 4 (10 subs) |
| Pro ($140/mo) | $140 | Month 5 (18 subs) |

## Risk Assessment

- Maximum downside: $237-948 (3 months of tool costs during stealth)
- No inventory, no employees, no overhead
- Pipeline has value even if Channel 1 fails (enables Channels 2-3)
- Time investment: 3-4 hours/week
- Skills built transfer to all channels
