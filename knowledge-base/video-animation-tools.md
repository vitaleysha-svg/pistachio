- SVI 2.0 PRO for infinite-length uncensored videos in ComfyUI
- 8GB+ VRAM, ~30GB disk space needed
- 20-40 minute generation times for 3-5 second clips

**HunyuanVideo (Self-hosted)**
- No content restrictions when self-hosted
- High cinematic quality
- LoRA fine-tuning available

### 5.2 Cloud Platforms with Fewer Restrictions

**PixelDojo**
- Free, no sign-up required

### RunPod Setup Checklist

1. **Provision RTX 4090 pod** (24GB VRAM, ~$0.74/hr on-demand or cheaper spot)
2. **Install ComfyUI** with latest version
3. **Download models:**
   - Wan2.2 14B (I2V + T2V) - ~30GB
   - Wan2.2-Animate-14B - for full body animation
   - LivePortrait models
   - MuseTalk 1.5 models
   - HunyuanVideo 1.5 (optional, for premium quality)
4. **Import workflows:**
   - Wan2.2 Remix uncensored I2V workflow (from Civitai/NextDiffusion)
   - Wan2.2 Animate workflow (from ComfyUI docs)
   - LivePortrait workflow
   - MuseTalk workflow
5. **Configure persistent storage** to avoid re-downloading models
6. **Set up RunPod template** for quick pod creation

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Wan2.2 is the cornerstone** of the self-hosted stack - it handles image-to-video, full body animation, and uncensored content all in one model family with ComfyUI integration.

2. **LivePortrait + MuseTalk** is the best open-source pipeline for talking head videos - fast, high quality, no restrictions.

3. **Kling AI** is the best cloud service for quick, high-quality SFW content at reasonable cost.

4. **For adult content, self-hosting is mandatory** - all major cloud platforms prohibit NSFW content. Wan2.2 with uncensored ComfyUI workflows is the proven path.

5. **AnimateDiff and SVD are outdated** - skip them in favor of Wan2.2 and HunyuanVideo.

6. **RTX 4090 on RunPod** can handle the entire open-source stack - Wan2.2 14B, LivePortrait, MuseTalk, and HunyuanVideo 1.5 all run within 24GB VRAM.

7. **Total startup cost under $100/month** is achievable with the recommended stack.
